a volume of 7247 mm shows to have been allocated to the reliant 201 contract

3 - 7578Subject: king ranch
there are two fields of gas that i am having difficulty with in the unify
system .
1 . cage ranch - since there is no processing agreement that accomodates this
gas on king ranch , it is my understanding hpl is selling the liquids and
king ranch is re - delivering to stratton . it is also my understanding that
there is a . 05 cent fee
to deliver this gas . we need a method to accomodate the volume flow on hpl
at meter 415 and 9643 . this gas
will not be reflected on trans . usage ticket # 123395 and # 95394 since it is
not being nominated from a processing agreement . we either , need to input
a point nom ( on hpl or krgp ) at these meters to match the nom at meter 9610 ,
or a deal for purchase and sale ( if king ranch is taking title to the gas )
needs to be input into sitara at these meters with the appropriate rate . i
have currently input a point nom on krgp to accomodate this flow , so we can
divert some of this gas to the current interstate sales that are being made .
2 . forest oil - there is a processing agreement that will accomodate flow
from the meter ( 6396 ) into king ranch . it is my
understanding that this agreement was originally setup until texaco had
their own processing agreement . i need confirmation that the gas from this
meter should be nominated on contract # ( 96006681 ) and that this agreement
should have been reassigned to hplc . ( it is currently still under hplr ) .
if this gas is not nominated on the above transport agreement , then once
again we need to accomodate the flow volume on the hpl pipe with either a
point nom or a sitara deal at meters 415 and 9643 .Subject: re : entex transistion
thanks so much for the memo . i would like to reiterate my support on two key
issues :
1 ) . thu - best of luck on this new assignment . howard has worked hard and
done a great job ! please don ' t be shy on asking questions . entex is

the purpose of the email is to recap the kickoff meeting held on yesterday
with members from commercial and volume managment concernig the entex account :
effective january 2000 , thu nguyen ( x 37159 ) in the volume managment group ,
will take over the responsibility of allocating the entex contracts . howard
and thu began some training this month and will continue to transition the
account over the next few months . entex will be thu ' s primary account
especially during these first few months as she learns the allocations
process and the contracts .
howard will continue with his lead responsibilites within the group and be
available for questions or as a backup , if necessary ( thanks howard for all
your hard work on the account this year ! ) .
in the initial phases of this transistion , i would like to organize an entex
" account " team . the team ( members from front office to back office ) would
meet at some point in the month to discuss any issues relating to the
scheduling , allocations , settlements , contracts , deals , etc . this hopefully
will give each of you a chance to not only identify and resolve issues before
the finalization process , but to learn from each other relative to your
respective areas and allow the newcomers to get up to speed on the account as
well . i would encourage everyone to attend these meetings initially as i
believe this is a critical part to the success of the entex account .
i will have my assistant to coordinate the initial meeting for early 1 / 2000 .
if anyone has any questions or concerns , please feel free to call me or stop
by . thanks in advance for everyone ' s cooperation . . . . . . . . . . .

sorry i ' m just now getting back to you . here are some answers to your
questions .
waskom is a field in east texas ( harrison county ) where we purchase gas from
pennzenergy at the bryson c . p . and jeter # 2 wells . the gas is termed up to
new
waskom gas gathering ( nwgg ) through june 2001 ( the term of the pennzenergy
purchase ) . we then buy the gas back from nwgg into our tetco east texas pool
. . . also termed up through 6 / 01 .
virginia field used to be associated with ngpl , but several years ago
pennzenergy worked out a processing arrangement with corpus christi gas
gathering , so the gas is now termed up with ccgm through 6 / 01 . . . priced off
of
the houston ship channel .
jennings ranch used to flow into ngpl through a gathering line , but a couple
of
years ago ngpl sold that line to midcon texas , so we now handle it as another
midcon texas property . sometimes we sell it at the meter to midcon texas
( kn ) ,
and sometimes we ship it through midcon to our ngpl south texas pool .
carthage : altra picks up their gas in their cartwheel agreement . the
agreement we nominate on is also a cartwheel agreement . it is not much
different than a hub agreement , except it allows title tracking . tgt on the
whiteboard refers to texas gas . . . east ohio takes their gas into texas gas on
a couple of different transport contracts .
let me know if you have more questions .

scotty / richard ,
our dbas would like to see what we can do to reduce the qty of rows in
contract _ event _ status . we have over 1 gig of data in that table . i would
like to suggest we have a nightly or weekly or monthly process to delete any
row with a last _ mod _ date over a month ( or two ) old . so if someone balances
february 1999 this month , we will keep it around for a month ( or two ) .
does any one else have a desire to keep this data for a shorter / longer period
of time ?
this is not an audit table . this is just a " log " every nom / track / balance / edi
send / fax send / sched qty / quick response since the beginning of time .

i ' m sorry , did we discuss bmc ? ? ? .
lee can confirm the accuracy of this , but bmc bought 20 , 000 from us and
intended no swing and no buyback . brandywine ( dorcheus ) controlled the meter ,
therefore it is their responsibility to make up the overs and unders . i
believe a deal is in place with brandywine to cover that very issue for
november . if not please let me know .

subject : re : meter 1428 oct 99 - beaumont methanol
lee ,
i need you to answer a few questions to resolve this issue .
first , you show a deal volume of 20 , 000 on nov . 7 and the pipeline confirmed
this volume . is this the volume you agreed to sell beaumont methanol ? this
volume is in agreement what the deal ticket says , the volume confirmed by
hpl , and dorcheus ' s volume .
second , the buyback issue is that a buyback is set up until june 2000 per
julie meyers notes she sends out every month ( last note sent dec 3 and you
are on distribution list ) . brandywine has nothing to do with this issue . it
is an issue between hpl and beaumont methanol .
do we have an active buyback in place and how do you decide to use the
buyback ?
this is a commercial issue that i need further clarification from you if you
have a buyback in place or not . if not , please notify julie and note on the
deal ticket that this buyback is no longer effective .
if it is still active , please contact chyral and resolve .
let me know the final resolution .

amiSubject: kerr mcgee : tomcat
hey joe ,
here ' s the response i got with regards to tomcat . i ' ve place another call
into david and let him know that the information we received included most
points except for tomcat . i ' ll keep you informed .
what i know is that the gas is sourced at mi 587 and moved on km ' s firm
contract . for as long as ces remembers , they sell the gas to entex . entex
chooses the pipe off which they take - - usually midcon - - also , hpl channel , or
tejas . km is invoiced directly . volume is approx . 2395 . the deal with entex
is written up monthly . km pays on a basket of indices . entex pays on the
highest index .

questions :
1 . at agua dulce , which pipe can the gp plant go into ? can it go into hpl ?
2 . do you have nom forms for any plant nominations we may need ?
3 . for gemc , is the tejas plant at thompsonville ? do you know how any of
those points tie into hpl ?
4 . do you have avails for mops production ? the gas that is transported to
tivoli - - what contract do you use ?
5 . for kerr mcgee , do you have the entex contacts you speak with ?
6 . is there a waskom nom form ? with whom do you speak over there ?
7 . for the avails sheet you sent , the first row of column titles is blacked
out . can you tell me what the row reads ?
8 . what volumes will come from koch gathering into carthage for next month ?
we show conflicting numbers .
thanks ,
ami
713 / 853 - 9272
here goes . . .
1 . i know tennessee , hpl , and tejas are at the tailgate of the plant , and i
suspect midcon texas is there as well .
2 . i ' ll fax you a copy of the nomination form that steve locke uses for agua
dulce and carthage . . . those are the only ones in texas that we nominate .
3 . the tejas plant as well as all of the other gulf energy receipt points
from
pennzenergy are exclusively tejas / gulf energy points , and it takes transport
charges to move the gas through gulf energy to interconnects , such as
thompsonville . the jennings plant does have a split connect with delhi , but
operationally pennzenergy much prefers to flow into gulf energy ( lower
pressure
= higher volumes ) .
4 . mustang island 759 for january is again 1 , 903 mmbtu / d , which peoples will
pick up at the wellhead . mustang island 785 is 4 , 100 / d , which leaves 2 , 200 / d
available to sell assuming we continue to transport 1 , 895 / d to fgt / tivoli for
peoples . our it agreement on nng is # 78581 to move gas from the wellhead to
onshore .
5 . the tomcat gas has been sold to entex into midcon texas for so long that i
don ' t think maria even talks to them anymore each month . tammi provides them
with the volume when she does the deal each month . but we can certainly
provide an entex contact if the gas is sold to them again in january .
6 . there isn ' t a waskom nomination form . the trader for this gas , mike
landolt , talks to ben britten ( president of new waskom gas gathering and
waskom
gas marketing ) .
7 . you must be referring to the page of offshore avails that begins with
sabine pass 13 . the 6 columns that appear blacked out read as follows : pvr ,
pvr , avail , dbq , dbq , and remainder .
8 . the koch - gathered volumes behind the carthage plant for 1 / 00 are 12 , 443
mmbtu / d .

round 2 :
1 . the 15 , 000 @ carthage for koch is an estimate of what we anticipate we
will
want to sell into koch . . . and it shows up on the koch whiteboard as a supply
( from carthage ) . during bidweek the traders will decide how much they
actually
want to show going to koch , and how much will be labeled base and swing . mike
landolt has been our sole koch trader and he typically takes some carthage gas
into koch , but i wouldn ' t say a particular volume is termed - up .
2 . other than very rarely shippling the jennings ranch volume over to ngpl ,
we ' ve always sold all of the midcon texas volumes to the affiliate . . .
currently done one month at a time . john hymel has been the trader for these
volumes .
3 . the entex sale @ tomcat has always been gas daily because that is the way
kerr - mcgee prices the supply . . . and entex has taken all the swings . the
january volume is 2 , 312 / d .

howard - the above meter indicates a daily swing with no one in volume
management ' s initials in oss . i need some information for daren before it
can be determined if a deal should be set up to cover the 089 contract for
11 / 97 forward .
i ' ve done some research as follows :
1 / 95 shows delivery on transport contract # 012 - 82269 - 02 - 002 ( southeastern
marketing co . as counterparty )
1 / 96 thru 10 / 31 / 97 shows delivery on transport contract # 012 - 27182 - 02 - 001
( esperanza marketing corp as counterparty ) .
11 / 97 thru 12 / 97 shows delivery on 089 - 41500 - 102
1 / 98 shows delivery on 089 - 41500 - 101
no other transactions at this meter since 1 / 98 .
some questions i need answered are - why was volume allocated to transport
contracts through 10 / 31 / 97 and then started to be allocated to the 089
contract later ? are the transport contracts no longer valid to allocate to
and is that the reason the 089 contract was used ? or should the transport
contract be allocated to instead of the 089 contract for 11 / 97 forward ? each
item indicates a delivered volume , so either a transport or sale is taking
place .
all the information that is supplied on the ua 4 report is need a contract for
9 , 448 mmbtu .
since the meter was assigned to someone else during this timeframe before it
was assigned to me , it ' s difficult to know why the 089 contract was ever used
for allocation and since there are no other records such as deal tickets in
cpr or oss .

they ' ll want baseload for january . the desk also appears to have some gas
nom ' d out here ( approx 1200 mm ) . rather than cut these volumes , would you
try to negotiate with koch not to flow this gas during the outage , but to

george ,
gary called me about this shut in situation a few minutes ago , specifically
regarding meter 6722 . this meter is at the tailgate of three rivers ,
therefore , an hpl field employee will not be able to contact the producer
( they probably have no idea where the gas is coming from that goes through
this meter ) .
gary suggested that the deal maker contact these producers verbally , and then
connie sutton will follow up with written notice . per our discussion , since
mary jo and gary are out this afternoon , i am forwarding this message to you .
the concerned contracts are : cody texas , lp , 012 - 64365 - 101 , 96018049 and
samson lone star , 012 - 77555 - 105 , 96016761 .
let me know if there is further information that i can provide .

i wanted to extend my thanks in advance to all of you who will join me in the

your holiday weekend to the continuing success story at enron .
as a company , enron has spent much time and effort to ensure that business
will continue smoothly as we move into the year 2000 . ken walther , in
working with many of you , has done an excellent job of preparing a work plan
for january 1 . your work on the first will be the final step in this
process . your efforts that day will allow all ena employees to return to the
office on january 4 th with confidence in our ability to continue business as
usual .
i wish each one of you a happy new year . i continually feel privileged to
work with this dedicated and talented group of employees . i look forward to
all that we will accomplish in 2000 .Subject: koch three rivers , # 6722

my cellular phone number is 713 - 562 - 2050 if you have any questions over the
weekend or holiday do not hesitate to give me a call . thanks .Subject: unresolved issues for jan 1 .
i think everyone agrees that there was a lot of confusion in desk assignments
and responsibilities . with that said , i am listing some of the current
issues that i have seen , that will need to be addressed quickly . most of
these issues are none of my business , but since i see unpathed gas i thought
you two might want to dicsuss these issues .
enron field services - has not been nominated since september 99 . have we
stopped doing business on this pipe ? ( just an fyi - ? ) do we need to get
this assigned ? i can find old
notes and try to get this pathed if necessary . someone just needs to let
me know .
lavaca expense transport - this is offsystem gas that hplc transports for
ena . ena has no nom at meter 1000 in pops for jan 1 .
midcon texas pipeline - there were deals left unpathed for jan 1 ( and
dec ? ) . i brokered and nominated the obvious but we seem to have 10 , 000 with
transport contract to move this gas on and no sale to broker to . as it
stands , it looks like we have a long position . who is this assigned to ? i
thought carlos was handling this one , but i could be wrong .
channel industries pipeline - several issues here :
1 . all deals with the exception of the long term transport expense were left
unpathed for jan 1 . i viewed prior month transactions and pathed
appropriately . someone
needs to review for accuracy . also , there were deals that went to zero ,
that were nominated for january .
2 . we still do not have enough supply to meet our sales requirement . this
issue has been left unsresolved since october 99 . volume management cannot
allocate was is
not pathed and nominated .
3 . there is a transaction for january that is once again not on our point
specific transport contracts . ( rec mtr 1 - 6366 10 , 000 to del mtr 2 - 6203
10 , 000 ) . this is a pathed pipeline . we have no rate . we need to know the
rate and whether one of the expense contracts needs to be amended for this
transaction , we are not legally covered . carlos was handling this pipe in
dec . who is this assigned to for jan ?
hpl operational - this shipper on hpl has been left unpathed for december
and january 1 . who is this assigned to ? this can wait until we get back
next week . if it is left unresolved , i will get it pathed when i return .
pat - the following was my recollection of the assignments for dec 1 to
the present . you might want to confirm with mary smith and then you can
proceed with decisions that need to be made based on possible unassigned
issues .
hank eisenhours duties were split :
mandey - handle all long term hplc expense issues : undeveloped contracts ,
december flow forward and cleanup of 1999 unresolved issues .
carlos - all offsystem transactions for ena and hplc in unify and all
offsystem paper and electronic noms on intrastate pipes . ami and stacey
also handle some . there is a lot of confusion here . i found unpathed gas
for december . we ' ll need to address this one quickly .
hpl transports were all split by zone . each logistics rep is responsible for
pathing all meters in their assigned zones in unify .
hpl operational seems to be left unassigned .
i think most of the desk assumed that carlos took over hanks
responsibilities . the assignments above are my recollection only .Subject: january setup - - mops
specifically , meter 1373 has several deals set up and 6 of them are ranked
10 . these will not allocate properly as you know . suggest you double check
all the industrials to ensure they are ranked correctly . january will then
need to be re - nomed .

a volume statement that confirms that volume did flow the 29 th and 30 th , a
total of 660 mmbtu . the problem is there is nothing in the system for meter #
9813 for 11 / 99 production . i looked in sitara , ( sitara # 132030 ) and the
deal starts for 12 / 99 production . i checked with donald to make sure and
he says that the meter did start up 11 / 29 and the price is hsc less $ . 10 . in
order to get this deal into the system , who do i need to talk to ? ? ?

susan ,
hope you had a great new year and holiday season ! i have a couple of issues
i want ot clear up for this year ' s contract .
the question is how valero wants to treat the three meter locations where you
are currently pulling gas . our new contract that was just sent to you has a
minimum take of 60 , 000 mmbtu ( estimated 35 , 000 @ 8018 celanese , 15 , 000 @ 1233
texas city , and 10 , 000 @ 1394 dodge street ) . if you undertake at any meter
excess volumes from another meter would be used to fulfill the entire 60 , 000
mmbtu . my accountant has told me that this is causing difficulties with the
two plants and how they want to see gas purchases broken out . we discussed
this on the phone and i got your consent to split these invoices . now we are
being told all three invoices need to be separate . since we always aim to
please the customer , here is my recommendation for handling the contract
through it ' s term . please let me know if this is fine .
celanese 35 , 000 mmbtu / d minimum on any given day if volumes fall below
35 , 000 hplc will buy back these volumes at gd katy mid
two days after flow
texas city 15 , 000 mmbtu / d minimum on any given day if volumes fall below
15 , 000 hplc will buy back these volumes at gd katy mid
two days after flow
dodge street 10 , 000 mmbtu / d minimum on any given day if volumes fall below
10 , 000 hplc will buy back these volumes at gd katy mid

kenSubject: cox exploration
darren , we had a situation in december that we need your help to resolve .
deal # 125836 we have been purchasing gas from cox exploration on pg & e
hydorcarbons systems upstream of the processing facility . this purchase
agreement terminated 11 / 30 / 99 . i didn ' t path the gas on pgeh , however , i
will take responsibility for not adjusting the interconnect ticket at
thompsonville . i didn ' t catch this and the deal on the hpl side appeared to
be a valid flow issue for kim vaughn . the plant continued to confirm this
gas .
we have tried working through the pipeline , but they state that they will not
know anything until the 15 th . can you contact the producer and ask them to
reverify this with the pipeline ? i would like kim to be able to zero confirm
and send back to pops so volume management will not allocate up to the
producer level .
also i just realized that we have a committed reserve purchase agreement at
the same meter with tribo production . should there have been an expected
volume in this deal ? is it possible that cox exploration sold their interest
in this well to tribo . it may turn out that we should have flowed the gas
after all .Subject: re : valero

i will leave robert to the above accounts . i will refer all contacts on this
subject to him for handling .
it is my personal belief that robert is not yet ready to provide all the
services necessary in this area , but i also know that full responsibility
often is a good teacher .
pat , as far as i ' m concerned i ' m out of the game .
i will help daren if needed and if not i ' ll be on my way .
good luck to you in your endeavors .Subject: marketing services / scheduling
daren ,
thinking about robert ' s little memo yesterday and along the lines of pulling
the marketing ( sitara ) function back to your side of the fence i think a
strong case could be made in favor of that idea .
it is obvious that several people are involved in changing tickets , pathing ,
nominating , and confirming the industrials . this dissipates the knowledge
base and the responsibility factor . it is a " who ' s on first " issue .
if the responsibility to ensure pricing , volume , and accomplishment of market
intent is accurately depicted , and in sitara , is in your shop then the
schedulers could concentrate on the accuracy and correctness of unify and
pops . i ' m sure this would help volume management and client services
immensely .
as the skill level rises in this area you could then gradually feed more and
more of the marketing function ( sitara ) to the scheduling group in the hopes
they would then have a better understanding of the overhaul picture .
i believe the current situation is too much , too fast , for scheduling to
handle all at once . it has also created a situation where robert seems to
think not only that he has all the segments mastered , but that he is the only
person that should be involved in the industrials .
i will support whatever direction you want to go on this issue , but if you
and pat leave things the way they are please explain to both robert and pat
that others may be involved in the industrial activity and that is quite
alright .
once again , thanks for listening .

subject : revision - black marlin - meter 986782 for 8 / 98 - ua 4
revision - according to measurement , there is flow of 7 , 394 in 8 / 98 , however ,
there is nothing to indicate this is gas that was received on hpl in oss . i
checked mips and there is a measurement statement that supports the flow rate
of 7 , 394 mmbtu .
daren is there a deal in cpr which may not have fed over to oss ? i checked
oss for the whole year of 1998 and there are no other deals in oss . it does
seem strange that this is the only month of flow .

garySubject: subject : rankings for source / destination
please forward to logistics in your region . . . . . .
would any of the desks be opposed to enabling unify to default the
destination rankings to the same rankings that are created in the source
rankings . there would still be the ability to change to ranking on the
destination side however , it would not affect the rankings on the source
side . this will save time pathing and prevent the amount of data entry
errors . would you please forward comments to your manager . dave
nommenson is aware that some of us are interested in this and would like to
find out if it would be something worth putting into production .

i wanted to make sure everyone had plenty of advance notice . i would like
each of you to review these times with your staff . the production release is
the largest to date and the time required to convert the data cannot be
shortened any more . production users will not be impacted by the lack of the

parallel as we do now for the period stated above ; however access to sitara
parallel will be kept to view only . a list of items included in this release
will be forthcoming , as well as training for groups impacted by the risk

i have had several requests from the ena business groups . now that the
agreement has been finalized , for report lists from your key applications ,
those
being , altra gms and risk works ( there may be others as people become more
aware ) . there will be a need for information for ena to manage contracts as we

anita :
i did some additional research regarding the sale to panenergy at meter 4045
on 2 / 27 and 2 / 28 . this sale was a brokered deal .
date purchase volume sale
2 / 27 & 2 / 28 phillips gas mkt . ( # 55397 ) 10 . 000 mmbtu panenergy marketing
( # 64749 ) 10 . 000 mmbtu
2 / 27 & 2 / 28 superior natural gas ( # 57065 ) 7 . 000 mmbtu panenergy marketing
( # 64749 ) 7 . 000 mmbtu
ect did not transport this gas away from meter 4045 . if this gas was
transported away from meter 4045 , it would have been a transaction between
panenergy marketing ( or whomever they sold the gas to at that point ) and
hpl . hope this information helps .

hi daren ,
i spoke with ricky archer at calpine about some penalty charges i billed him
for undertakes on dec 20 , 21 , 31 .
he said force majeure letters were sent to your attention .
if you have them , would you have someone fax a copy of those letters to met
at 713 - 646 - 8420 ?
do you have any other information on the force majure or should i speak with
jennifer ?

thanksSubject: re : hl & p for 12 / 99
it is the pipelines decision on how to allocate between the shippers ,
however , if the pipeline allocates the shortage to ena then we need to follow
the contract language and bill accordingly . just remember that we allowed
makeup on the 18 , 19 , & 20 th for a total volume of 5 k over 3 days so that
will apply toward the 4 th and part of the 9 th . all other volumes should be
purchased back per the language in the contract . remember they have a
tolerance of 5 % below the nomination .

i ' m sitting here a bit disappointed and pissed .
do you and pat honestly believe it is " one man ' s word against another " on
setting up the link builder by the 12 th of the month ?
if so , why have i been saying something is wrong with some of the links for
the last several days ? and why did i work so late the first couple of days of
each month setting up the links when i had so much time ?
i ' m not going to play this game with mr . lloyd . when he took the time to show
up he was coached well in what was needed to be done , how to do it , and when
to do it .
this situation was entirely predictable . it is always " i ' m about to do it "
and it is always an " i thought you said . . . . . . . . . . . . . " situation .
you know better . i won ' t be hung out again .

anita :
i did some additional research regarding the sale to panenergy at meter 4045
on 2 / 27 and 2 / 28 . this sale was a brokered deal .
date purchase volume sale
2 / 27 & 2 / 28 phillips gas mkt . ( # 55397 ) 10 . 000 mmbtu panenergy marketing
( # 64749 ) 10 . 000 mmbtu
2 / 27 & 2 / 28 superior natural gas ( # 57065 ) 7 . 000 mmbtu panenergy marketing
( # 64749 ) 7 . 000 mmbtu
ect did not transport this gas away from meter 4045 . if this gas was
transported away from meter 4045 , it would have been a transaction between
panenergy marketing ( or whomever they sold the gas to at that point ) and
hpl . hope this information helps .

attached is a file with my allocations of texas operations to be used for the
2000 plan . however , please note that their are some problems / clean - up that
needs to occur that i could not do .
as you requested , i have taken the % we allocated to gas assets last year and
put the appropriate % ' s into the appropriate group within gas assets as you
have broken them out . please note : gas network trading is the same group as
st gastexas ( group 8 ) - tom martin is responsible for both . i have indicated
the appropriate % ' s into the new buckets , but i was not able to zero out the
st gastexas group as the cells are protected . consequently , the total column
indicates that i have allocated over 100 % . the # ' s in gas network trading
are correct . will you please delete st gastexas so that no one will allocate
to it ?
when the plan allocations were submitted last year , there was an error in
rcl 160 - volume management . i thought we corrected it but it is still
showing up incorrectly . please move the 8 % under east origin to st gaseast .
i was not able to correct this either as the cells have been protected .
please note : this is not a change from the plan , but a correction of an
error .
i would appreciate you correcting these things for me , and forwarding the
corrected version back to me for my records . i will be working with our

please read brian ' s memo below . we spoke briefly about this yesterday in the
staff meeting . i have copied each of you on a memo earlier today where i
have provide the 2000 plan allocations . please note that we were not making
changes to the plan , only breaking the gas asset group into smaller buckets .
any chnages which have been made since the budget was approved are not
reflected on the allocation sheet . rather they are reflected on the 1 / 00
allocations , and they will require explanations each month as all variances
from plan do . this includes new rc ' s which have set up , etc .
i need each of you to review the 2000 plan allocations as i submitted them
earlier today , and provide an accurate allocation of your rc for 1 / 00 . what
has your group spent their time on in 1 / 00 ? ? ? please be aware that we could
receive questions from the commercial teams , so document your logic . some
things to consider :
project sally - allocate to gas network development
project hurricane - allocate to ? ? ? ? - ( i have a call into jim coffey )
denver business - allocate to rocky mountain asset originations
if you have some other activities and your not sure where to allocate them ,
either call me , jackie nelson or jim coffey .
one other thing to note : the network trading group will be further broken
down into 2 groups : trading ( tom martin and jim schwieger ) and
transportation ( ed gottlob ) . although the attached worksheet does not
include this breakdown , please include it in yours .

assets team . the assets team is now broken out into the following " groups "
which are described in the attached word document :
rc # team name rc owner
the 2000 plan file now has columns for the above teams , please take the
percentage that was previously allocatated to assets ( which is in the
executive column ) and reallocate it among all of the teams except rocky
mountain asset originations that you support . i have already inserted the
new percentages to be used for rocky mountain , which are based on a portion
of the upstream origination allocation that was determined by the assets
group . consequently i have changed the allocation percentage for upstream
origination . i have also protected all of the cells except the ones you need
to change to avoid confusion .
i also need you to update the percentages to be used for january 2000
actuals . i have added the new rc ' s that we have set up since plan has been
complete , so please make sure you have each rc 100 % allocated .
i will need the updated plan percentages returned to me by noon wednesday
january 19 th , and the updated january 2000 percentages returned to me by end
of day friday january 21 st .

howard ,
this memo is regarding the 91 , 297 mmbtu imbalance that was created in april
of 1999 on
transport contract # 012 - 41991 - 02 - 004 . the transport delivery off hplc was
shorted to keep
entex whole on a minimum purchase from ena . originally this transport
imbalance was to be cleared
the next month in may of 1999 . some of the imbalance was cleared in may of
1999 , but 91 , 297 mmbtu
still remains as a imbalance on this contract . we need to monitor the ifhsc
index for the upcoming months
so that when one is compatible with the ifhsc index of april of 1999 we can
clear this imbalance . we will
need to allocated 91 , 297 mmbtu extra to the transport . this will reduce the
purchase from ena by 91 , 297
mmbtu for that month . i need you to watch over whoever is doing the reliant
energy - entex allocation to
make sure this happens .
thanks ,

subject : carthage plant imbalance
i ' ve discussed the carthage plant imbalance with chad cass at duke energy
( carthage plant operator ) and willie shannon at devon energy and here is what
i ' ve learned . duke and devon met last fall to discuss the imbalance , which
according to devon was approximately 240 , 000 due to duke at 8 / 31 / 99 . devon
acknowledged that an imbalance existed but didn ' t think it was that high .
both
parties seemed to take the position that the other side needed to prove them
wrong . according to duke the imbalance grew by 120 , 000 in september , 16 , 000
in
october , and another 12 , 000 in november ( all round numbers ) bringing the total
to approximately 395 , 000 through the end of november . based on current month
estimates , duke thinks january sales are 1 , 000 - 2 , 000 / day higher than
production , and would like to see a cut in sales of 4 , 000 / day effective friday
1 / 21 / 00 in order to balance for the month of january . again devon disagrees
with this daily overage , based on their production estimates , but since they
recognize an imbalance exists , willie @ devon has agreed to reduce the volume
available for sale by 4 , 000 / day effective friday the 21 st . this will reduce
the amount of " excess " gas ( gas daily - priced ) that enron has available to sell
at carthage .
additionally , beginning february lst duke requests payback to the plant of
5 , 000 / day , continuing until the imbalance is worked off . devon should reduce
their lst of the month availabe volume by 5 , 000 / d to accomplish this , and
enron
needs to verify if that reduction is factored into the numbers when they are
setting up february activity .
a key point to this imbalance issue , and one that i believe all of the parties
agree on , is that ces , now enron , purchases devon ' s carthage gas at the
tailgate of the plant , so any production - related imbalance is between devon
and
the plant ( duke ) and make - up volumes only reduce what enron receives from
devon . enron is not buying the gas from devon and turning around and paying
back a historical imbalance . however , since ces ( and now enron ) is set up as
devon ' s agent at carthage , duke communicates the imbalance information and
coordinates make - up arrangements with enron . enron in turn needs to verify
with devon that devon has adjusted their available volumes to reflect any
make - up . hopefully once actual make - up commences , devon and duke will strive
to reconcile to an actual imbalance that they both agree on .
please call me if you have any questions @ ( 713 ) 693 - 2581 .

subject : project hurricane / bridgeline status
here is a quick status and list of to do ' s related to setting up the new j . v .
between enron & texaco which will be combining the lrc and bridgeline
pipeline systems :
summary : the lrc & bridgeline pipeline systems will be combined under the
name of bridgeline llc . ownership in the jv will be split 60 % texaco & 40 %
enron . bridgeline gas marketing llc will be the entity that will be trading
on the pipelines under the new j . v . contracts and service agreements are in
the process of being drafted .
enron will be providing the trading and commercial operations systems to
support this j . v . texaco will be providing the scada system . i understand
that accounting is still being discussed . the trading , risk , & perhaps
scheduling personnel for this jv will be initially relocated to the 21 st
floor of the enron building and will eventually move to probably the 3 allen
center once a more permanent spot can be built out . trading for the new jv
will start in early february for march production .
to do ' s :
accounting : i ' ve asked jim coffey to set up two work orders to capture it
transition and ongoing costs . texaco is also trying to set up a meeting next
monday to step through the accounting flow so that we are all on the same
page and make sure there is nothing that will fall through the cracks .
pc ' s : jim fussell is in the process of ordering the pc ' s for this jv at my
request . i will need the work order numbers to track these costs .
networks : i ' m coordinating with arshak and his team to make sure that the
voice and data networks are in place for eb 21 . once the more permanent spot
is nailed down we will then need to do the same for that location . a
combination of trader phones , lucent phones , stenfons and amtels have been
requested .
location on eb 21 : i ' m waiting on a call back from chris larson from
facilities to find out what locations on 21 will be assigned to the new jv .
currently half of the floor is empty but they are set up with high wall
cubes . there may need to be some build out for the traders to low wall
cubes . we can ' t set up the pc ' s , phones , amtels , etc until this is done .
data conversion : i have requested from texaco the contract , deal and
meter / facility information we will need to set up in our systems to begin
trading for march production . it may be possible to get an electronic dump
of this data from texaco if enron defines the data fields that we will need .
we also need to set up the trading entities and portfolios . i will also need
to know who will need to have access to this data so that we can set up the
system security . i have received the names of the traders but i don ' t know
who else will need access .
interface between enron ' s unify pop ' s application and bridgeline ' s scada
application : i ' ve asked dave nommensen from enron to get with carryn wright
from texaco to begin the process of defining the interface between the two
applications and estimate the time to build and implement the interface .
there will also need to be a transition plan put in place where lrc ' s
rtu ' s / efm is redirected to the bridgeline scada system . in the meantime
there will be two scada systems and perhaps two gas controls until everything
is merged into one . this will probably mean some manual interfaces between
pop ' s and scada for confirmed noms and efm volumes until the transition is
complete .
scada communications : currently the lrc rtu ' s / efm communicate back to
enron ' s scada system via leased lines . bridgelines rtu ' s communicate back to
them via a microwave system . the new jv could save on communications costs
by switching lrc ' s rtu communication to the microwave . perhaps this is best
done as a part of the scada transition .
accounting data needed by texaco for royalty purposes : this data needs to be
better defined . i will follow up with john ledoux from texaco to get this
process started .
hourly volumes : bridgeline currently has one utility customer who may be
billed on an hourly basis depending on the amount of swing . we need to talk
through this process to see what enhancements may be needed . at least
initially there will need to be some manual processes in place to support the
billing for this one customer .
please let me know if you ' d like to meet on any of these topics . i can have
my assistant set up the meeting if needed . in the mean time i can be reached
at 713 - 853 - 6858 . thanks ! - tommySubject: entex transaction 7

thanks , patSubject: meter 1428 - brandywine / dupont and beamont methanol
my contact at beaumont methanol asked me to tell everybody in our shop the
following : to clarify whom to contact about the nomination and scheduling
for beaumont methanol at meter # 1428 .
first some background : we feed beaumont methanol through a meter station
that we own and control , but which also feeds brandywine / dupont . in fact ,
the gas goes through a dupont pipeline header downstream of our meter station
before it gets to beamont methanol . sometimes we are doing business with
both beaumont methanol and brandywine / dupont . . . . . but sometime we only do
business with one of them .
whom to call for any nominations and scheduling issues for beaumont methanol :
bob dorcheus - brandywine / dupont - 281 - 293 - 1789
chyral hankins - beaumont methanol ( terra ) - 712 - 233 - 6558
please do not call the beaumont methanol control room at the plant with
regard to scheduling and nomination issues . they are out of the loop on
these issues . if we call the beaumont methanol control room at the plant
with regard to scheduling and nominations issues , it will cause confusion of
the type we had yesterday and today .
obviously , it is of course ok for hpl gas control to call the beaumont
methanol plant control room on any emergency operational issues .
thanks . . . and have a great weekend .

this as one of the things logistics could do to help them maintain reasonable

please make sure you know the status of each of your pipes and speak to the

appropriate ena desks will take place either wednesday or thursday evening :
ces - im east to ena - im east
ces - im central ena - im central
ces - im texas ena - im texas
this move will be done systematically for january forward business . after
this move is complete , there should be no active deals remaining on the ces
desks . the following is a list of deals that i wanted to bring to your
attention and review . one of the base assumptions expressed by all was that
there were no transport usage tickets booked on the ces desk . this is not
true ; however transport usage tickets will be included in the change over ;
therefore this will not be a problem . on the east desk , three desk to desk
deals will not be able to be converted ( see below ) . once all ces deals have
been changed to the east desk , i would imagine that these three desk to desk
deals need to be killed .
please advise if there are any questions regarding the desk move . if any
desk prefers to leave january as is and have deals moved february forward ,
manual deal entry will be involved ( ending the deals as of 01 / 31 / 99 on the
ces desk and creating a new deal on the appropriate physical desk ) .

just following up to my week ago note .
rest assured i know how hectic things have been around here and how many
irons you have in your fire . time for my issues are , i ' m sure , a lower
priority .
let me offer a thought or two .
i don ' t have enough challenges at the moment to hold my interest .
i had asked for next wed and thurs . off . let ' s toss in fri also . my
expectation is you would have a plan by the time i would come back , monday
the 7 th . i hate to be a pest but you need to get a better value for the
paltry salary $ ' s you are paying me . maybe a tues - thurs . week would work
better for each of us . or if things are going the way they seem to be ; you
don ' t need me at all .
if you could possibly let me know before the 7 th what the plan is i sure
would appreciate it .
thanks ,
ken
p . s . just in case the plug is pulled on this - - - please - - no formal goodbys .
i will pay my respects to those i want too . i would very much like to just

just a quick note to follow up on ua 4 issues .
for desk to desk deals , we are keeping the entry on co 89 since there is not
a co 16 contract with co 16 and attaching an ect transport contract to the
backscreen .
on park and ride deals , i am under the impression that the park and ride deal
would be booked to an 089 contract and cleared either intra month or in a
subsequent month .
if this is true , was it done by reversing out or offsetting the previous co
89 entry . i am not sure whether an ect transport should be attached . i hope
you have some insight on this issue .

the stock is traded under the ticker symbol  & ene .  8Subject: organization announcement
enron purchases billions of dollars of products through its wholly owned
subsidiaries and venture companies worldwide . historically , the company has
conducted these purchases in a highly fragmented , decentralized manner
allowing each of the operating units the discretion to source their
requirements in a manner that optimizes unit performance . today , however ,
with the implementation of sap and the profound explosion in
internet / intranet - based technologies , we believe the company should change
its direction and focus on aggregating its demand for goods and strategically
sourcing these requirements on a global basis . we believe that there are
significant cash savings to be extracted by the company and also commercial
potential for the formation of a highly profitable , business - to - business
e - commerce venture .
effective february 1 , 2000 , enron will form a new global strategic sourcing
unit . this new unit will consolidate the current successful strategic
sourcing initiatives underway in the gas pipeline group , global asset
operations and enron corp . initially , global strategic sourcing will focus
on aggregating enron  , s internal , joint venture and business partner demand
for products and services with the objective of creating a future
business - to - business e - commerce venture .
it gives us great pleasure to announce that george wasaff , managing director ,
will lead this new global initiative . george will report directly to mike
mcconnell , chief executive officer for global technology .
george has been with enron for fourteen years and has held many senior
executive positions , the most recent of which was managing director of enron
south america ' s wholesale operations . george was also the interim chief
executive officer of elektro from july 1998 through june 1999 and chief
executive officer of transportadora de gas del sur s . a . ( " tgs " ) from june
1995 through february 1998 . george has also held numerous commercial
positions including vice president and country manager , mexico for enron
international and vice president of marketing for transwestern pipeline
company .
please join us in supporting this new global initiative and congratulating
george in his new role with the company .Subject: increase volume into midcon

aimee :
there is a bridgeback error at the above referenced meter and month . the
reason for the error is that the deal , # 97929 has expired . please determine
if the deal was to be extended or is there another deal to replace it ?
to fix this i will set up an accounting arrangement but what i need from you
is a valid deal number and the transportation contract that you want me to
put the deal on .

mmbtu / d
from fuels cotton valley and 25 , 000 mmbtu / d into pg & e .
i talked to darren and brian on the ability to swing additional volume to pg
& e
during a day ,
and they said pg & e won ' t accept daily changes at all ! ! ! so , if that is the
case ,
we will have to find an alternate method to swing the volume . based on our
agreement ,
we have the ability to give them volume into other pipelines at the hub .
maybe
we
can swing on them . in the short term , however , we are going to have to make
due
with adjusting
the hpl volume to equal redelivered volume as best we can .
sorry for the lateness of this email . i will get daily nom changes into you
earlier next week .

buy side as well . it will no longer show the the error ( s ) generated by the
sales side as it currently does . this change will coincide with the way sap
reports intercompany transactions .
please let me know if you have any questions or concerns .

subject : buyer vs . seller on intercompany deals
it has been brought to my attention that sap will not use the buyer as the
governing value associated with intercompany deals but the seller .
currently , sitara captures the volume bridged back on the buy side not the
sales side . i wanted to make sure that those of you who would be impacted by
the change were aware of how sitara would reflected the volumes associated
with intercompany deals . if there are any concerns with this , please let me
know as soon as possible . i will need to have an adjustment made to the
volume feedback reconciliation report to reflect this change once it has been
finalized . it may be a month or two before this is implemented but i wanted
to make sure everyone had advance notice .
if you have any questions , please do not hesitate to contact me at x 39222 .
thanks ,

- egmnom - feb . xlsSubject: some after thoughts to our meeting
hi daren ,
i enjoyed our lunch together yesterday and believe we made a good beginning .
you have very high standards for your own performance and are highly
committed to the best outcome in all situations . you are likely to have high
expectations for results from our coaching meetings this a good formula for
success and i will do my best to honor your strengths with a focus on moving
the action forward . with this in mind , i had some thoughts and additional
questions for reflection following the meeting that i would like to share .
you are in a transition from being a high team performer to becoming the
leader of a high performing team . one of your frustrations as leader is
that members of your team seem to rely too much on you to solve problems
that arise in the day to day operations of the team . at first you responded
to their requests for help by solving it for them , then you shifted to using
questioning techniques to have them solve the problem with you . you have
also offered some training to address the learnings needed to be more
independent problem solvers . you are frustrated when some members of the
team continue to come to you with questions they should be able to solve and
when they fail to implement changes that you have trained them to use . you
are seeking ways for the the team to have the same problem solving ability
that they come to you for . you have recruited people with this ability and
you seek to expand it in the team .
this issue was the focus of our first session and needs to be the focus our
next meeting . the question is : how to engage the team in solving this
problem . how do i get the members of this team to own this responsibility
and begin creating their own solutions ? what resources are needed by each
person to contribute more to this problem ? how do i involve the team members
more in the solving of this problem ? what new behaviors do i need to employ
to increase the involvement of the team ? what do i need to change in myself
or my relationship to the people in order to engage them more actively in
the problem ?
there is one dimension that i am clear about . i know that you have used
performance appraisals to give feedback . have you put this issue before the
team as a whole for the team to solve or have you tried to change individual
team members ?
i look forward to our meeting on the 17 th . keep growing !

ami ,
sorry that i haven ' t followed up yet , but we are in the middle of
implementing sap ( which i ' m sure
you have heard about ) , and haven ' t had time to put the sample report
together .
what i have at
present is a report from our scada system that must be run manually each day ,
to get a report of
yesterday ' s volumes , beginning and ending at 7 : 00 a . m . the problem is , until
i
can revise it , the
report shows all of our city gate volumes for all suppliers , and i need to
create a new one with only the
hpl stations . i also want to set it up for automatic creation , to run at
approx . 8 : 00 a . m . daily . it would
then be available to you for viewing via some type of bulletin board , such as
is
currently being operated
by george perrine . i will be coordinating this effort with george in that
regard . until i have completed the
entire task , however , i will try to send you a daily ( 5 days per week ) report
created manually , showing the
previous day ' s volumes for our monitored hpl stations . i am shooting for
starting this tomorrow .
i have also been discussing this with royal edmondson of our gas supply
dept . , and he wants us all
to meet to discuss coordinating our efforts and sharing all information
between
all interested parties . he
will be getting back with you on this .Subject: change into midcon due to ppa

george ,
there seems to be a problem with mips while trying to actualize
the january 2000 data ( y 2 k related ) . in order to actualize jan
pops has to manually load the actual files into pops , the
side effect of this is that some of the feb data may be loaded
with numbers that are old . this will be rectified as we complete
loading the jan actuals and then load the most recent mips
measured prelim numbers for feb .
pops is currently processing the mips files in the order they
were received , we should be done with this today . please inform
us of any abnormalities that you see tommorrow .
thanks

we have been looking at the daily volumes for the gathering contract to
analyze the producer services portion of the p & l . to do this , we have been

approximately 612 , 000 . mops shows a daily bav of approximately 601 , 000 . i
wanted to confirm that these volumes sound reasonable for you . by the way ,

our people tell me that the t / a is going as planned and clmp plans to begin

week to get to full rates . in any event , clmp plans to begin pulling gas at
reduced rates late sunday or so .Subject: alternative work schedule status
as you might already know we had to reschedule our second meeting that was
scheduled for wednesday 2 / 16 to tuesday 2 / 22 in room 3013 . lunch will be
provided . i apologize and will avoid rescheduling our meetings in the future .
i was encouraged by the excellent dialogue and contribution at our first
meeting and believe we have the right group together to make the changes we
know are needed in our work hours .
here is the list of items we agreed to cover at the next meeting :
schedulers were going to touch base with their pipeline reps and other
contacts on the different schedules they are using and document and discuss
at the next meeting .
each manager was going to discuss with their group what would work best for
their desk and present this to the group at our next meeting
bob was going to gather information on external 12 hour schedules and follow
up with hr on schedules being used at enron
the following is what i heard at the first meeting :
our first item should be to establish a weekend and holiday schedule that
would more or less guarantee ( other than maybe an occasional call ) you have
the weekend off . cross - training seemed to be the key here . some desks seemed
to doubt this could be accomplished with current staffing levels .
cross - training is not an easy thing to accomplish and takes a " just do it "
attitude .
there doesn ' t have to be an across the board solution for logistics . however
all solutions we come up with will need to be formally documented so it will
be easy to move to other alternatives as the business needs of each desk
changes .
late daily hours are a reality and at some desks tied directly to traders
willingness to do deals at any time . as we get a better handle on what other
companies are doing we might be able to find something that will help address
this . everyone is realistic about the exceptions such as bid - week etc . and
really have no problems with those times when a long day is part of the job .
there were mixed reactions to a dedicated weekend team as opposed to some
type of rotating group . mixed feelings about whether the group would be open
to a mandatory rotating weekend schedule .
feel free to get back to me if you have any comments or clarification . i ' m
looking forward to our next meeting - bobSubject: lindholm oil , inc .

thuSubject: re : sale to shoreline
daren you are correct in that this was only in mops for the 26 th . it was
edi ' d over to pops from the 25 th through the 31 st populating all days with
the 16 , 700 nom . the nom was never - 0 - out in pops therefore the change
notification process in pops did not pick up a change at this meter . this
meter is pathed by kim and confirmed by me - it is extremely odd that this
was missed in mops . the record would have been out of balance and someone ,
if not several people , normally would make a comment on this . also - all
of my records indicate that the 16 , 700 was good through the 31 st except the
mops entry . my confirmations with koch didn ' t reflect the - 0 - ; the last
report i have from koch indicated the 16 , 700 stayed on , there was no record
of a phone call indicating anything other than 16 , 700 . it is very odd for
this many checks and balances to fail . also , the volumes were being sent
back to mops which no one caught .
i have spoken with koch today and they agree that the 16 , 700 should have gone
to - 0 - therefore i have removed the nom from pops confirmed volumes and
re - allocated the meter . the oba has taken the hit and i am working off the
imbalance now .
daren , i am sorry that you had to look into this when you feel this is my
responsibility . stella was trying to help me out in clearing up errors
because i was buried in current activity , thus the e - mail to you asking for
your help .
if this doesn ' t answer all the questions , just give me a call .

stella and charlotte ,
i looked into this deal . we sold this gas for one day only . in mops , the
path was nominated for 1 / 26 only . however , in pops the path was nominated
and confirmed for 1 / 26 - 1 / 31 . this should have been showing up as a
bridgeback error during the month . also , someone should have identified that
the path / nom in mops wasn ' t the same as the nom in pops . this discrepancy
should have been found before we closed out january .
i researched this problem by reviewing both systems ( looking at the path id
in pops , finding it in mops , and checking the audit on the path in mops ) .
this type of issue should be researched and solved by the logistics group ,
who has all the necessary tools to find the problem . the resolution , not the
problem , should have been presented to myself or the marketer , with an
explanation of what happened . some one still needs to find out how the gas
was confirmed for the 27 th - 31 st .
since the gas apparently flowed , we will have to apply the overflow to the
oba . unless you can find a missing transport contract .

welcome to the expatriate zone
welcome to the " first " issue of " the expatriate zone , " the official
newsletter of the new " expatriate zone " web site . after publishing " the
temperate zone " for the past two years , i ' m taking the opportunity to join
forces with bob segel who has been publishing " the coconut modem " with karen
coyne since april of 1994 .
last year , after operating in aol exclusively , bob created " parrotkey . com "
out on the " internet " where it would join it ' s sister site on aol and be
accessible to all parrot heads . at the time bob expanded " pk , " we had been
working on my little area of " club st . somewhere , " and the new
" parrotkey . com " seemed like the perfect place to open the doors of the club .
while we were talking about the direction we wanted to see " club st .
somewhere " and " parrot key " go , we could see that this was the perfect chance
to , as emeril says , " kick it up a notch . "
jimmy buffett ' s music was a big part of our lives , but even more so was the
" expatriate lifestyle " he sang about . a lifestyle that includes tropical
travel , sailing , boating , parasailing and surfing , and yes , the music and
lyrics of mr . james w . buffett .
so it is , that we created our new web site , " the expatriate zone "
, along with this newsletter of that same
name . in december , " the expatriate zone " opened its doors with its " island
trading post " with its holiday shopping service at the " island trading post . "
over 3 , 600 people visited the site the first day , and daily prizes were
awarded for the first two weeks . the " island trading post " will open again
soon , offering a complete line of tropical items , not just to those of us
that live a few blocks from wal - mart , but also for those of us lucky enough
to be on a sailboat or living on an island . for not , we ' ll start with the
" t - shirt of the month . "
we want " the expatriate zone " to not only keep you entertained and informed
while you toil away at your everyday " corporate gig , " but it will also get
you ready for that day you finally shuck it all and disappear down into " the
expatriate zone . "
we hope you all enjoy our new effort , and also continue to visit " parrot key "
and " club st . somewhere . " both of which will be closely associated with " the
expatriate zone " and " parrotkey . com . "

" expatriate of the month "
james " sunny jim " white
when i first ventured on the internet in 1995 , i ran in to a guy named " sunny
jim " who was living down in the cayman islands . we never really got a chance
to connect , for which i am truly sorry . but , when something is supposed to
happen , it usually does .
on the first leg of my " road dawg " tour
( click on " road dawg " ) i stayed with my good friend alex & janet leist and
their wonderful children . over the five days i stayed at their house , alex
and i listened to a lot of music , and one of the guys we both liked was
" sunny jim . " i bought one of james ' cds from alex , and fell in love with it
immediately . the cd was his second , called " life in the laid back lane . "
little did i know that i would meet up with james and his roady " shady floyd "
several times over the next six months . james was embarking on his first real
tour of the us since he moved " down island " almost twelve years ago . we got
several chances to talk over the summer , and we will have an in depth article
about this " expatriate " soon on " the expatriate zone " web site . be sure to
watch for it .
in the meantime , here are a couple of quick things i learned about this great
musician . when i asked him about his " expatriate " status , his reply was ,
" technically , an expatriate is someone who lives outside their own country ,
for whatever reason . for some it ' s legal reasons , others just because they
want to , or that ' s where the work is . i have been an expatriate for nearly
twelve years now . i have pretty fully lived the whole caribbean experience ,
from climbing the coconut trees and spear fishing , to sailing , scuba diving ,
hot afternoons on the beach and romantic moonlit nights under the swaying
palms . "
even as james is about to repatriate himself and his family , i ask if there
were any other places he would consider living as an expatriate ? " maybe
somewhere on the coast of mexico or in a group of islands that are all within
sailing distance of one another , " was the advice he gave .
until we can learn more of " sunny jim ' s " world , stop by his web site at
and if you don ' t have one of his cds , including his
latest release " sandbar serenade , " for goodness sake , pick one up . you can
also read a great interview alex conducted with james at

travel into " the zone "
" some are running from the irs "
we strongly believe that we all have to get away from our computer screens
and out into the real world as often as we can . does this mean we give up one
our most useful tools of communication , computers ? heck no ! with laptops ,
cell phones and gps systems , we can go anywhere , and still stay in touch if
we feel the need . but get real and throw that " pager " away as soon as you can .
we hope to keep this section current and informative , hopefully hearing from
those of you already living your lives in " the zone , " helping the rest of us
prepare for our getaway from the cities . i ' m sure there are some of us that
are preparing to " disappear " to places like costa rica , where the " the
expatriate zone " will become an important tool .
how would you like to check out a place to " disappear " to and write it off
your taxes at the same time ? want to go down into " the zone " to places like
the bahamas , belize , st . croix , puerto rico , bonaire , the dominica republic
or saba ? want to do something for the planet , work with dolphins , save a
coral reef , or study monkeys and the rain forest at the same time ?
well we have the answer . check out these organization ' s web sites , and then
get some advice from your financial advisor on 501 c non - profit organizations .
depending on the tax bracket you ' re in , uncle sam could end up paying for up
to half the trip .

after that , all that ' s left is to make that plane reservation , and remember ,

" jimmydotcom "
after many delays , " jimmydotcom " has finally gone to the printer with a due
date of the middle of april . i hit some " bumps in the road " on my way to
publishing the first ever book about the parrot head phenomena , but it was
all worth it .
this book isn ' t about jimmy buffett , it ' s about the effect of the internet on
parrot heads . for more information , visit . we
have a complete outline of the book , reviews from other parrot heads , and
samples of the pages on the site .
financial considerations have limited the first printing to 1 , 000 copies at
the present time , so if your even thinking of buying a book , i suggest you
reserve your copy by putting your name on the " reservation list . " you will be
under no financial obligation . it will simply indicate to my financial
partners ( who aren ' t parrot heads ) , just how many books we need to print . do
it right away , because pre - sales were brisk , and if enough of you reserve a
copy , i can get the financing to expand the first printing .
let ' s show the world what parrot heads stand for by making this book a big
success . when i was on the bhotm tour this summer , i had many people tell me
they wanted to buy an extra book to give to their boss . they wanted the boss
to understand why getting the day off for a buffett concert is so important .
maybe it will help the rest of us to explain ourselves to our friends " that
just don ' t get it . "
here ' s one of the latest reviews of the book from bob robinson , founder &
president of the sandlapper phc in south carolina . i had a great time with
this club on the " road dawg " tour , and shared an advance copy with his club :
" when we received jackson ' s plea for pictures , our members were blown away .
we hustled up a package of pix , as did a majority of the parrot head clubs
from around the globe , and the result is pure parrothedonistic pleasure . this
collection is bound for glory in the annals of island time . if moderation is
your key to life then stay away from jimmydotcom , ' cause this book is packed
with those stories only we can tell . congratulations bubbafreak ! "

club trini update
speaking of expatriates , how about the guys who play the true music of " the
zone ? " club trini ' s long awaited live cd will finally be coming out this
april , one year after it ' s recording . jimmy has been keeping mike and robert
pretty busy , so it ' s understandable that it took awhile . it will be the third
in the " margaritaville cafe - late nite " series . i can ' t wait to hear it , as
my wife and i were some of the lucky ones who were in new orleans when it was
recorded .
you can get a look at all the songs included on the new cd at club trini ' s
revamped web site at . along with the great songs we ' ve
become accustomed to , are a few i ' m pretty excited about . if you haven ' t
heard ct ' s version of " african friend " you ' re in for a real treat . along with
that , is a song that tina and nadirah have been treating audiences to this
past summer , " cario " and bob marley ' s " no woman , no cry . "
at the new web site , fans can " now " order their favorite club trini cds using
their credit cards . so there ' s no excuse to not owning everything available .
i think a true " expatriate musical library " is incomplete without club trini .
this summer , helen hiatt , jimmy and the coral reefer ' s wardrobe designer ,
came up with a shirt that club trini members lovingly call the " ice cream
vendor " shirt , which they wear out front at the start of the concert . ok ,
pete sometimes forgets his , and when he does have it on , it lost it ' s sleeves
somewhere along the way . there ' s a great design that has been applied to a
t - shirt that we all can own . check it out at their site .

when an email just isn ' t personal enough .
the original artwork is also on sale at this site , so be sure to stop by and
visit them . included in the " jesters " series are our good friends tim glancey

millennium change bubba style
i ' ve got to tell you , i wasn ' t buying into this " new millennium " thing , one
bit . in fact , i had almost decided not to go to the buffett new year ' s eve
show . nothing to do with jimmy , but i just didn ' t get the whole hype . but at
the last minute , i had a change of heart .
and now after being a special guest at seagram ' s party honoring the new
margaritaville tequila , i ' m sure glad i went . the shows kind of melded
together for me , making the millennium change over very special .
if you want to hear more about this or see some pictures of both , visit our

flash ! ! ! " expatriated phans " spotted south of the border
after making both of " tropo travel ' s " previous trips down to cobo san lucas ,
mexico , i had to miss this year ' s trek due to my being with the " beach house
on the moon " tour on it ' s florida , new orleans and houston swing .
as the story goes , those bad boys and girls from " the expatriated phan club "
showed up again , mainly for the t - shirts that
said , " too much tequila . . . or not quite enough " on the back . who are those
people anyway ? whenever i go to their web site , all of them have black bars
covering their eyes . if you want to see pictures of the trip or need info for
" down to the banana republics - 2000 " visit mike
mclain also has some other great trips planned this year , check them out .
speaking of " tropo travel , " if you need a hotel room for the vegas or irvine
shows and want a great deal , visit there site for some great rates . i ' m
joining some of my parrot head friends at the " key largo , " though i ' m kind of
afraid to be in a town like vegas with sue and ponch aprea from the detroit
phc . i ' m joining a lot of my other friends i met on the road there too . i
hate seeing jimmy in vegas , but i ' ve got to keep the streak alive , and seeing
all my parrot head friends will make it all worthwhile . i hope peter mayer
ends up playing there again this year .
and speaking of those great t - shirts , we have some neat shirts available at
the " island store . " they ' re similar to the shirt you got if you went on this
year ' s trip , except they have " tropo travel ' s " seaplane on the back and the
" no bad days " logo on the front breast . you can see a picture at

this meter has not been disconnected . the measurement tech turned in a
temporary disconnect to mips ( about 2 months ago ) because the meter has not
flowed for approximately 4 months . this allows the measurement tech to forgo
testing the meter until it is ready to be put back in service . scheduled

i need the above referenced contract put into pops for january , may , june ,
july , and august 1999 forward . i need the contract in pops for august
forward because i never know when copano will allocate line gain to itself .
in 1998 a spot contract was set up between hplr and copano pipeline / south
texas , l . p . with a synergi contract number 078 - 62210 - 101 and a global number
of 96016880 by karen lambert . per karen this old agreement was terminated by
dan hyvl due to hplr business change to ect . in 1999 , when copano began
allocating line gain to themselves again i contacted lauri , karen , and
yourself to see if i could get the contract in pops . karen sent me an e - mail
indicating that she set - up a new contract for this hplc line gain purchase -
global # 96022367 ( i don ' t have a " synergi " contract number ) . i know that in
3 / 99 lauri contacted bernard widacki at copano to discuss this issue .
i need lauri to review this and then i need the contract to be put in pops so
that i can correctly allocate the gas at this meter . i have not allocated
any line gain in 1999 and the volumes are small . karen is the most
knowledgeable about this contract , so i suggest that any questions be
directed to her regarding contract issues . karen worked with bernard widacki
at copano to set up the contract originally .

of you for taking time out of your schedules to meet yesterday . the results
of our time exceeded my expectations in that i feel we had quality discussion
and also identified some ideas and solutions to put in place quickly . each
of you contributed concerns and discussion ideas in a very professional and
positive manner . i also realize we have some follow - up to do , and would
like for us to schedule our next time to meet . i don ' t want to establish
these discussions as " quarterly " or " monthly " meetings at this point - i ' m
not sure what frequency would be appropriate . we can discuss it further as a
team . however , i know we at least one more session and i don ' t want much
time to elapse before we reconvene .
yvette : would look at a time when everyone would be availble in march ,
preferably the week of 3 / 6 , 3 / 13 or 3 / 20 . this may be difficult to schedule
as daren will be working around a new baby , and others are working around
vacation time . i anticipate a similar structure to yesterday ' s , but am very
open to other ' s ideas . please let yvette know if you some other idea .
i also want to express my appreciation to yvette for organizing the
afternoon . she did a great job ! ! !

1757978Subject: hgpl and kgpl - 3 rivers gas
based on the conversation we had at the meeting last thursday , i am
implementing the following changes to humble gas pipeline and king ranch gas
plant . if you disagree or feel you had a different understanding than the
items below , please be sure to call me asap .
1 . input hplc purchase from hplr liquids at meter 8793 ( hpl / hgpl ) . remove
the 3 rivers gas from the interconnect ticket and input on
the purchase deal .
2 . input hplc sale to hplr liquids at meters 9643 ( kgpl / hpl ) and 12
( kgpl / hgpl ) . remove 3 rivers volumes from the interconnect tickets
at these meters and input on the sales deals appropriately .
3 . change swing parameters for the king ranch contracts to swing on cage
ranch before swinging on 3 rivers gas . this will hopefully allow
the sale for 3 rivers gas to remain at one meter as much as possible .
i will hopefully have all of these changes made by the end of the day , and
have all contracts repathed . it is my understanding that we are implementing
these changes effective feb . lst .
stella , this may or may not effect repathing of the hplc gas at meter 9643 ,
based on the swing parameters that you have been using .

hey guys ,
just wanted to make known my concerns on this issue . while i agree that
howard , robert and george needed to work on this together , i do not think
that howard should have been the driving force behind this . once we left the
meeting , they all convened on the 37 th floor and worked from howard ' s desk -
with howard sitting down doing much of the work . i also think that the below
e - mail should not have come from howard , but should have originated out of
the logistics group . i understand that howard has prior scheduling
experience , but he is not functioning in a scheduling role now and bascially
took on that role in getting this set up correctly . he too had to sit down
and try to figure out what needed to be done and set everything up correctly
( ? ) . in my opinion this is a kudoo for howard for stepping up , but i am
concerned at the role that he played . team effort is important and it ' s what
we all want between our groups , but i want to ensure that everyone does their
fair share and expectations are appropriately placed . let me know what you
both think . thanks !

x 3 . 5953Subject: monthly charges for analysts on your rc report
i wanted to let all of you know how you will be charged for analysts if you
currently have or will have one in your rc for the year 2000 . the analyst
program is being handled differently than it was in 1999 . in addition to the
normal salary , benefits and payroll taxes , you will also be charged an
overhead administration fee for the program . you will be charged the
following monthly amounts for each analyst in the detail class code that i
have indicated below :
detail class description amount
1 salaries and wages $ 4 , 000
552 benefits 774
557 payroll taxes 360
820 corporate services 1 , 266
total monthly cost $ 6 , 400
the $ 4000 amount represents an average of all analyst salaries and does not
indicate what the analyst in your rc is paid . this amount will not change in
february as the $ 4000 already includes merit raise information for 2000 .
the $ 1266 represents the overhead costs of administering the program ,
including campus recruiting and office visits .
when you look at your rc report , you will see a line item labeled " a and a
reclass " in each of the detail classes identified above . enron north america
is invoiced by corp . for the costs of all analysts . financial operations
makes a manual journal entry each month to charge the appropriate rc . please
check your january 2000 rc report and make sure you were properly charged for
the correct number of analysts you have currently . if there are any errors ,
please let me know as soon as possible so that i can work with brian heinrich
to have it corrected in february . please continue to check your rc report
each month going forward . thanks .
if you have any questions , please call me .

hello ,
we are starting to prepare the february data for our model . please provide a
completed " hours " survey for each position within your group . this survey
will collect the the time your team spent on performing their activities in
the month of february .
at the top of the spreadsheet , you will see a box labeled " select your rc " .
click on the box and input your rc number , which will need to be 4 digits .
once you have done this , another box will appear with the message " select
position from drop box ! " you can then select the position ( i . e . , staff ,
specialist , etc . ) and " ok " . the choices for positions are based on
information contained in the org database ( i . e . , if a position is not listed
that should be , please call me to discuss as it would indicate that
corrections need to be made to the database ) . once you have the list of
activities , please input hours ( for the entire month ) for each activity
listed in the column labeled " hours " .
if you ' re filling out the survey for your team , save a file for each of the
positions you fill out for your team prior to filling out the next position .
if you do not , the information will be lost .
we have included january compiled hours per position ( if you had two
specialists performing the same activity - 20 hours each , the " last month "
column would show a total of 40 hrs for that month ) . as with last month , you
have the option to complete the survey on behalf of your entire group or send
this survey to each of your team members , allowing each individual to fill
out the time they spent on each activity . if there are any activities you
perform not included in your survey , please contact me as soon as possible
for a copy of the activity dictionary .
please return these surveys by end of day friday , march 3 rd . if this is a

select your rcs , and fill in the driver quantity for the requested driver for
the month of february . please fill out the attached activity driver survey
with february numbers for your rc by end of day friday , march 3 rd . if your
group currently generates a standard report that captures the surveyed data ,
please send the report to me , and put me on your recipient list beginning
next month . this will eliminate your need to fill out this survey every
month . if you would like us to collect this information from someone within
your team beginning next month , please let me know .
please take this opportunity to verify the following :
1 . the driver indicates a measure for the time and effort your team spent to
perform these activities for each commercial team .
2 . the activity is spent in support of the commercial teams identified
( please let us know otherwise )
3 . if the activity is using an allocation ( for example " allocate 0469 " or
" 80 - 20 split " ) , that the percentage allocated to each commercial team has not
changed from last month . ( please let us know if it has changed what the new
allocation is ) .
in reference to these surveys , please note :
if you are allocating only infrastructure costs to some commercial teams
listed in the survey , please identify them . we will take your business
support costs ( such as feedback , training , etc . ) and allocate them evenly
among these teams .
the costs for " commercial team specific " activities that you filled time out
for in the january time survey will be directly allocated to that commercial
team ( e . g . genco support will trace 100 % of its costs to genco ) .
please let us know if you have any questions on this survey .

subject : monthly charges for analysts on your rc report
i wanted to let all of you know how you will be charged for analysts if you
currently have or will have one in your rc for the year 2000 . the analyst
program is being handled differently than it was in 1999 . in addition to the
normal salary , benefits and payroll taxes , you will also be charged an
overhead administration fee for the program . you will be charged the
following monthly amounts for each analyst in the detail class code that i
have indicated below :
detail class description amount
1 salaries and wages $ 4 , 000
552 benefits 774
557 payroll taxes 360
820 corporate services 1 , 266
total monthly cost $ 6 , 400
the $ 4000 amount represents an average of all analyst salaries and does not
indicate what the analyst in your rc is paid . this amount will not change in
february as the $ 4000 already includes merit raise information for 2000 .
the $ 1266 represents the overhead costs of administering the program ,
including campus recruiting and office visits .
when you look at your rc report , you will see a line item labeled " a and a
reclass " in each of the detail classes identified above . enron north america
is invoiced by corp . for the costs of all analysts . financial operations
makes a manual journal entry each month to charge the appropriate rc . please
check your january 2000 rc report and make sure you were properly charged for
the correct number of analysts you have currently . if there are any errors ,
please let me know as soon as possible so that i can work with brian heinrich
to have it corrected in february . please continue to check your rc report
each month going forward . thanks .
if you have any questions , please call me .

x 3 - 6343Subject: training resources and cost to attend energy operations systems
classes
as a follow - up to stephen schwarz ' s message below regarding training
resources , i wanted to let everyone know that there will not be a charge in
2000 for any energy operations employee to attend any training classes that
have been developed by energy operations ( i . e . , sitara , unify and
magellan / livelink ) . there will be a charge to your rc , however , if an energy
operations employee signs up for one of these classes and fails to cancel
within the established guidelines .
i know there was a lot of concern regarding your budget and costs for
training classes after the corporate training department announced that there
would be a change in policy this year . your rc will be charged a fee for any
course that your employee signs up and attends through ernie . i just wanted
to clarify the costs associated for any systems training detailed above will
not be charged to your rc even though you and your employees use ernie to
register for these classes . i have instructed the people in the training
department who are in charge of billing to follow this policy . if you
receive a charge in error on your rc report , please let me know immediately
so that i can make the necessary corrections .
if you have any further questions , please call me . thanks .

compressor problems . they think that it will be for at least a week but you
know how that goes . they would like to drop the volume again to 4400 . if we
change don ' t kim will have an imbalance at this meter ( she wanted me to let
you know that ) . meter # 6598 yates would like to change the volume from
4206 to 3366 , and vintage who had been over producing last month would like
to increase from 270 to 320 to match the real flow . i know these are

the rates are in the system correctly in unify ( so that we can invoice
correctly ) , but daren ' s group uses a sitara deal ( the transport usage
tickets ) to estimate desk transport in the p & l during the month . right now
we have not entered in or corrected rates in their transport usage tickets .
our group has not taken that step , since we have been most concerned with
settling the g / l ( after the month is over ) . by not having the right rates on
the transport usage tickets , the risk is that the p & l will be off during the
month . would we change process and let daren set up the transport usage
ticket and then have us enter the rate ? if so , we would need to change the
process with his group to put us in the process so that we can enter the
correct rate . please let me know what you want to do .

fyi . . . the economics group publishes this report every month to show how much
the marketing desk spent in transport . they can get their expense numbers
either from their estimate ( from cpr ) or from unify , where we put the rates
in .
one potential enhancement would be that in addition to managing rates for the
transport capacity tickets , we set up the rates for the transport usage
tickets . i am going through the transport usage tickets for february right
now ( as part of the market meter study ) and i see some rates i don ' t tie back
to lauri ' s matrix . for example , lauri ' s matrix shows 0 . 05 from thompsonville
to hsc , but the transport usage ticket ( updated by daren ' s group ) has 0 . 055 .
this means the economic estimate can be off . let me know what you want to do
with this .

below is a list of sitara deals that had volume variances or where one side

solution . i am taking a simplistic approach here in that since

gas is not pops . i looked in path manager and there is no deal for it
either . in december , the deal for this gas was 114096 . could you extend the
deal or get me the number for the new deal if there is one ? i need to set up
an accounting arrangement so i will need for you to verify the deal number
and transportation contract that this gas is supposed to go on . when i set
up the accounting arrangement i will let you know what the track id is so you

attached you will find the salary survey questionnaire for your review . you
will need to fill out the questionnaire for each exempt job group in your
department . please be as specific as possible to ensure we are capturing all
the skills needed to accurately price the job . if you have filled out the
questionnaire in the past , you may want to update the information . i will be
happy to address any questions you have regarding the form .Subject: p & l
tom , we attached both a consolidated p & l and an updated prudency schedule .
the weater hedge made $ 165 , 000 today . the only odd thing that we saw was the
physical change due to deal changes with the hplc operational desk . this desk
is a desk that is set up to account for fuel , gas loss , and physical ua 4 , we
have tickets out there with zero volumes on them that get updated after the
month is over once volume management knows where the gas needs to be
allocated . what we found out that happened was that in the last week of
february and in the first week of march sitara added volumes to these tickets
before were were running comparison reports to see the changes . darren
noticed the incorrect volumes on these tickets and had logistics zero them
out . darren thought that the changes would have no position effect as if it
were a deal between hplc and texas , but it is actuall as if we changed a deal
that we did with another region . the value was offset by changes in tufco
and storage . we released $ 270 , 000 out of march prudency to keep you flat for
the day . hope you had fun at the school function . i ' ll be here until about
8 : 30 , so feel free to call if you get this .
bryanSubject: just a note
hi ,
i figured something must be occupying your time other than answering
non - business e - mail .
you guys must all be getting double salaries for doing 2 jobs each . - - - -
right ? ( chuckle ) .
if tom really lets you take the time off for the baby and if you really have
the time ; lunch would be great . just give me a call . only if all the ifs
really allow you the time .
is craig ok ? ? i hope .
i would be glad to help with your sprinkler system . my sharpshooter is older
than you are , but i imagine it is built a little better . my requested wages
for that sort of work would make renting a trencher very cheap for you . i
would be happy to come by and keep an eye on the cold beer . that would be
free of charge .
i ' m having a cable modem installed monday . supposed to be 50 - 70 times faster
than what i have . i do way to much jumping around to run off this slow modem .
i can then dump my other phone line . actually will end up spending less for
more speed . i love technology .
thanks for the info on the stock option . that is the closing price as of
1 / 18 / 00 , which is right before the jump . very nice of management . i like to
know the number to see what might be affecting the price .
well good luck on the extra job and give our best to tonya - - - - not much

3 - 9497Subject: sitara position
please use the position manager home button .
when using the sitara position manager , and you drill down to view details
or change the dates , the position manager keeps
all your views running in the background . this feature allows you to use the
back and forward buttons to keep your views running .
on the downside , if you keep these views running but do not really intend to
go back to look at them , the system and your pc are working harder
to keep all the old views active and updated .
the home button sends you back to your default view - the first view you had
up when you hit apply . by clicking this button , your
position manager will clear out the old views the next time you drill in .
this is the only way to clear out the old views that you no longer need .
if you do not use the home key , and keep drilling in and changing the dates ,
the position manager is still keeping all the your views for
the day running in the backgound .
what we have found is by the end of the day , a user that does not clear out
the old views can have well over 30 views open , which is like having
30 position managers up on your pc . when that user closes down , the position
gets locked up for a while as it tries to clear out all the old views .
we will be making some changes soon to that should resolve this issue as far
as the sitara machine is concerned ; however , your pc may still be
slow with excessive unneccessary views open . we could make a change to
limit the number of active views you can have open , but at this time
i am not sure that is necessary ; regardless , in the mean time , please
remember to use your home button .
other helpful hints -
did you know you can shrink you tool bar ? tools options - uncheck show tool
bar text labels -
did you know you can split your position screen to have pipes on top and
zones and meters below ? tools options - show drill down second panel -
if you have an omicron position porfolio - your min / max button shows you
actual - and min / max for your day swing deals .

it looks as though this meter is flowing starting 3 / 1 / 2000 . i guess that the

enron capital minnesota power
and light co . , opinion no . 12 , issued april 14 , 1978 , mimeo at 24 - 5 .
[ 65 , 229 ]
in both cases , the commission rejected rate design features where there was
no evidence in the record showing that the rate design features reflected
cost incurrence , id . in its order setting this proceeding for hearing , the
commission took note of edison ' s proposed seasonal differential and
specifically directed that the parties fully address the issues related to
the cost support for the seasonal rate design , commission order issued march
30 , 1979 , mimeo at 4 - 5 . on october 9 , 1980 , the parties were directed by the
presiding judge to identify in their initial briefs the portions of the
record that relate to cost support for the seasonal differential .
the requirement that edison provide cost support for its seasonal
differential , as discussed supra , is also set forth in the commission ' s
filing requirements for rate schedules : if the rate design is intended to
reflect costs , the applicant must show how it reflects costs ; if the rate
design is not intended to reflect costs , the applicant must justify the
departure from costbased rates , 18 cfr o 35 . 13 ( b ) ( 4 ) ( iii ) statement p .
edison ' s seasonal differential is intended to lessen the costs imposed upon
it by its prominent summer peak . edison reasons that , since it must build
capacity to meet its prominent summer peak , charging more in the summer would
give customers an incentive to control their summer demands and , therefore ,
edison ' s cost of adding capacity would be reduced ( tr . 169 ) . accordingly ,
edison must show how its seasonal differential reflects the costs imposed on
it by summer demand , under the commission ' s filing requirements in 18 cfr o 35 .
13 ( b ) ( 4 ) ( iii ) statement p . further , even purpa section 111 ( d ) ( 4 ) relied upon
by edison states that rates " shall be on a seasonal basis which reflects the
costs of providing service to such class of consumers at different seasons of
the year to the extent that such costs vary seasonally for such utility . "
( emphasis added . )
further , support for relying on marginal rather than average costs comes from
the commission itself . in its order of march 30 , 1979 setting this cause for
hearing , mimeo at 4 , 5 , the commission , in commenting on time of day and
seasonal rates , mentioned that it encourage innovative rate design to match
more closely rates to costs . in this regard , the commission cited its order
no . 537 , supra at 4 , which specifically suggests use of pricing mechanisms
based on marginal cost principles
[ 65 , 236 ]
for jurisdictional wholesale sales . under the circumstances in this case ,
where the sale of economy energy is related to edison ' s costs in adding or
eliminating additional excess capacity , it is appropriate to establish the
price for economy transactions on marginal costs . this provides a more close
matching of the rate to the cost than would a rate design based on average
costs . accordingly , winnetka ' s position on pricing of economy energy will not
be adopted .
affirmed and reversed - see next paragraph
comm - opinion - order , 23 ferc ? 61 , 219 , commonwealth edison company , docket nos .
er 79 - 182 - 000 and er 80 - 106 - 000 , ( may 12 , 1983 )
turning to commonwealth ' s exceptions , we find that the judge correctly
rejected the seasonal differential . even if we accept the company ' s
interpretation of purpa , it still has not cited any record evidence
whatsoever of a difference in costs between summer and nonsummer months .
without at least some showing of a cost difference , it is impossible to make
a judgment on the reasonableness of the company ' s 15 . 25 % proposal . we
therefore uphold the judge on this point .
we reverse the judge ' s adoption of a price set at 110 % of the utility ' s
incremental costs , however , and approve the type - b split - savings method
proposed by commonwealth . under this method , economy transactions are
arranged for a 12 - hour or similar period at a fixed price based on cost
estimates at the time of the agreement . if the utility ' s incremental costs
rise to the point that continued supply would become burdensome , the utility
may terminate supply . we find this method superior to that proposed by staff
in that implementation is greatly simplified . cost determinations need not be
made as frequently .
related to pmas
reg - preamble , fercsr ? 36 , 710 , procedures for public participation in power
and transmission rate adjustments and extensions , december 31 , 1980 , 10 cfr
903 , 45 fr 86976
[ 36 , 741 ]
historically , many purpa - type standards have been used in designing wholesale
rates for the sale of federal hydroelectric power . pmas analyze costs to
establish revenue requirements and consider this information in designing
rates . declining block rates for energy were once used by the pmas but
subsequently were found inappropriate and eliminated from rate schedules .
many of the pmas for years have been effectively using various forms of load
management measures in their rate schedules , such as scheduling limitations ,
loadshaping , capacity and energy overrun charges , etc . bpa has had a history
of using seasonal rates for wholesale firm capacity and energy and also
offered its direct service industrial customers interruptible rates some time
ago . southwestern has had interruptible capacity rates in effect since 1957 .
these examples demonstrate the willingness of the pmas to implement
purpa - type standards where applicable .
many of these purpa - type standards , when applied appropriately in the design
of pma rates , can serve to implement the purposes of purpa by encouraging
conservation of energy , efficient use of resources and facilities , and
equitable rates . the public participation process will provide an opportunity
to examine these and other appropriate concepts .
the pmas will continue to review and revise their power marketing practices
on a system - by - system basis to serve the purpa objectives . the assistant
secretary for resource applications , working with the administrators of the
power administrations , and after receiving public comment , will consider the
adoption of rate design guidelines , similar in form to the guidelines in ra
6120 . 2 on financial accounting and ratemaking , which will reflect the
experience gained by the pmas in their system - by - system approach to rate
design .

( 4 ) seasonal rates . - - the rates charged by an electric utility for providing

seasonally for such utility .

9331 , 55 fr 31882
pricing flexibility may take several different forms . for instance , a
contract could provide qfs with a price floor applicable to all the power
supplied to the utility , but still provide for higher variable unit prices
reflecting daily or seasonal periods . the price floor would provide the
revenue stream necessary for the qf to secure financial support while
[ 32 , 174 ]
the price variability would induce the qf to maximize deliveries in peak - load
periods when the utility values additional supplies most . of course , the
price floor should not exceed the minimum value of the utility ' s avoided
cost . similarly , a contract could provide for a two part price - - a fixed
payment for capacity and an energy price for power delivered . the qf would be
assured a minimum revenue stream based on the value of its capacity . the
variable energy component would allow the utility to dispatch the qf capacity
only when it was economic . whatever the pattern of contract payments , rates
for purchases from qfs should always reflect how well the characteristics of
the suppliers ' power match the purchasing utility ' s need . this will ensure
that the qf will make most production decisions on the basis of rates
reflecting avoided costs ( rather than the guaranteed average rate ) and , at
the same time , will receive revenues sufficient to attract investors .
to avoid problems such as those associated with take - or - pay contracts in the
natural gas industry , the commission wishes to stress the danger of including
forecasted fuel costs in the fixed rate structure of long - term contracts ,
especially in combination with the specification of minimum purchase
quantities . the commission also encourages the use of time - of - day and
seasonal rates in flexible pricing structures for long - term contracts .

docket no . rm 79 - 55 , 18 cfr 292 , 45 fr 12214 , 45 fr . . .
rather than specifying that exact time - of - day or seasonal rates for purchases
are required , however , the commission believes that the selection of a
methodology is best left to the state regulatory authorities and nonregulated
electric utilities charged with the implementation of these provisions .Subject: kn changes upstream on the 60 k to 92155 for the 5 , 000 and we bring

we need to get together this afternoon at 2 : 00 pm in room 3745 to discuss how
we will schedule and allocate the hplr liquids coming into humble gas
pipeline at meter 8793 . karry , it is my understanding that you do not want
an intercompany sale from hplr liquids to hplc at this point . how do you
plan to get this gas to king ranch since hplr liquids does not have a
transport on humble ?
daren , the intercompany hplc purchase is how it is set up currently in mops .

hcSubject: re : hplr liquids / humble gas pipeline
just wanted to keep everyone on point in terms of the importance and
expectations of getting this king ranch issue cleaned up for the prior months
and correct on a go forward basis . i spoke with brenda on friday to give her
an update of our progress and one of the things that she stressed and wanted
passed on to the team was the expectations that king ranch would be clean
( scheduled and allocated correctly ) for march and foward . as of thursday
night ' s p & l calc . , unaccounted for march 2000 on texas was a little over
400 , 000 mmbtus . as you all know , that number is way too high and should be a
lot lower ( on a bad month , no more than 100 , 000 mmbuts ) . hopefully , if king
ranch is the part of the problem for march and we get these issues resolved ,
march will not be an issue . i appreciate everyone ' s committment so far and
hopefully we can apply this team concept in the future to prevent crisis
modes like this from here on out . if anyone has questions or concerns ,
please do not hesitate to let me know . thanks !

subject : mobil discrepancies
lee ,
here are some specific situations i am trying to resolve regarding volume on
centana :
purchase from mobil :
2 / 99 - the purchase by hplr for 155 , 000 mms in deal 60978 was never billed by
mobil .
( a purchase of gas in storage with no physical movement per comments in
sitara ) .
per our conversation friday , it sounds like hplc does owe mobil for his
gas , right ?
sale to mobil :
1 / 2000 - per the pipe statement provided by greg bonin for centana volumes ,
299 , 893
flowed in january . i billed 299 , 893 and mobil paid it .
logistics said 19 , 893 of the gas that flowed was not our sale to mobil
because
the gas wasn ' t scheduled . in addition , if the 19 , 893 were a sale to mobil ,
the
point would not be in balance in the system . the source of 280 , 000 of the
gas
says they only sold 280 , 000 mms and not any more . no other sources are in the
system .
i assume if the 19 , 893 wasn ' t consumed by mobil , they wouldn ' t have
paid for it . is there storage involved here ? if so , whose storage and how
did it work ?
there are sales in other months with discrepancies on centana with smaller
volumes
than in 1 / 2000 . once i understand what happened in january , maybe that will
help me
with the other months .
please let me know if there is any other information you need from me
relating to
the questions above and when would be a good time for you to discuss this . i
can bring
the pipe statements to you if that would help .
thanks ,

in reviewing some of the imbalance numbers , i discovered that valero texoma
( # 71 ) bav volumes have not fed into pops since 3 / 14 causing an out of balance
at the meter in excess of 500 , 000 mm month to date . the more critical part of
this problem , however , is that pops has fed 0 volumes back to sitara on some
of the hplc deals . this means that these purchase volumes ( expenses ) have
not been picked up in tom ' s p & l and are , instead , sitting in ua 4 . to the
extent that the purchase prices vary from the ua 4 value , the p & l may take a
hit when these actual volumes flow through .
i realize that kim is out and that you guys are stretched thin , however , a
problem of this magnitude needs to be addressed as soon as it ' s discovered .
someone needs to be overriding the 0 volumes so that sitara is receiving

the current month is 7 , 327 mmbtu instead of 7 , 000 mmbtu per day . 7 , 000 is
the volume delivered to cilco after transport fuel .

this is an outside measured volume that we don ' t receive volumes on until
month ' s end so systematically , no information equals zero . spi , the software
vendor for mips is investigating all of the rules currently in place for file
transfers , particularly 0 volumes . the only possible solution is to tag all
zero volumes sent in the nightly file process as ( i ) incomplete . i will let
you know the outcome of this investigation and the monies required to
complete . we may require a work order to complete based on the outcome of the
investigation .

jeff / gary ,
where is measurement in the process of sending pipeline operations more
complete data ? we continue to have this problem at various bidirectional
meters and meter 980071 below is the latest casuality . when mips sends
pipeline operations a zero prelim , this becomes the best available number and
overlays the estimate that gas control sends us . when this happens &
scheduling doesn ' t catch to override the zero , the desk ' s expense is
understated . this is causing a huge mess for texas operations . what is the
plan to move this up on measurements priority list ? we need an answer asap ! !
charlotte ,
at what other meters are we having this problem ?

subject : pg & e texoma volumes
in reviewing some of the imbalance numbers , i discovered that valero texoma
( # 71 ) bav volumes have not fed into pops since 3 / 14 causing an out of balance
at the meter in excess of 500 , 000 mm month to date . the more critical part of
this problem , however , is that pops has fed 0 volumes back to sitara on some
of the hplc deals . this means that these purchase volumes ( expenses ) have
not been picked up in tom ' s p & l and are , instead , sitting in ua 4 . to the
extent that the purchase prices vary from the ua 4 value , the p & l may take a
hit when these actual volumes flow through .
i realize that kim is out and that you guys are stretched thin , however , a
problem of this magnitude needs to be addressed as soon as it ' s discovered .
someone needs to be overriding the 0 volumes so that sitara is receiving
correct information and the p & l is kept as accurate as possible .

week outage for repairs . unfortunately , due to delays in the delivery of a
coupling needed to finish repairs , we have extended the downtime for
another week . we hope to be up april 2 nd or 3 rd if all goes well .Subject: re : meter 8740 dec 99
robert and i put our heads together and decided to enter the partnership
agreement on the days in question to keep the third parties whole .
thu - it will be reallocated in about five minutes .
if you have any questions , please let me know .

subject : re : meter 8740 dec 99
we do not have deal to enter for this . you need to look at the entire midtex
line for each of the days that are out of balance . if we are short at katy ,
i would think that we would be long at dewville . ( many times , our receipts
from the midtex line at katy are offset by our deliveries to tufco at the
tap . ) this should help you fix the january problem . also , for december , you
may need to ask pg & e where they show the delivery for western . is it at hpl
katy , as our records show , or is it at pge ' s another point on the midtex
line ? in any case , we don ' t have deliveries to make . the only other remedy
is to book the variance on the partnership imbalance .

stacy - can you please set up a new deal for meter 8740 for dec . 99 . the
problem with this meter is , all third party transports should stay whole and
hpl takes the swing . several days the meter did not flow enough and the
third parties did not receive all of their gas . i need a delivery set up so
the 3 rd parties will stay whole . if you have any questions , please let me

aimee ,
we are still having problem with this meter . from what i understand of our
conversation a week or two ago , hpl needs to take the swing to keep the other
contracts whole . in the case where we have excess flow the hpl ( r ) contract
takes the swing . so in the case where we are short , shouldn ' t we have a hpl
( d ) contract to take the swing ? please let me know if this will work . i
need to get back with settlement today . thanks

good afternoon !
no , this isn ' t a new tip - just a follow - up on the one i sent this
morning . i received some good responses and wanted to pass a couple of them
along .
kevin wrote to say that this tip works like a charm , except for one thing :
he ' s had trouble with the router bit not being perfectly centered on the
base , so his dadoes have ended up less than perfect . i referred to this
briefly at the end of the tip , but here ' s a quick solution for avoiding
the problem .
before routing the dado in the gauge , first mark a point on the base of
your router . ( i simply add a piece of masking tape since it ' s easy to
see . ) then when routing the gauge ( and later , the panel ) , always keep
this mark against the straightedge . your dadoes should be right on .
another email came in from mike , who suggested making two alignment
gauges . then you can clamp one at each end of the workpiece before you
clamp the straightedge fence down . this prevents the " wiggling " that
often occurs when one end is clamped before the other . great tip !
a big thanks to all who have been sending in suggestions . it ' s great to
hear that so many people are enjoying the tips .
talk to you again in a few weeks .

karie : deal number 60747 should be the good deal . deal number 60747 is an
interruptible storage deal and contract 96016959 is an interruptible
contract . storage deal 47472 is a firm storage deal . since it doesn ' t agree
with the firmness of the contract , i would probably cut off that deal going
forward . - tommy

there are two storage deals that are using the same contract number . julie
meyers believes that deal 47472 is the correct deal , but wants to check with
you first since you put in deal 60747 . let me know when you look at them if

lee ,
i did my fuel gas estimate and think that we will need 120 - 125 bbtu / day of
fuel
gas for the month of april . on a side note , we will bring down our gas
turbine
generator on sunday morning . this will bring our high pressure gas
requirements
down to essentially zero ( it will be zero if our hydrogen plant stays down )
and
the demand will transfer to our low pressure gas . we will be in this
arrangement for approximately 20 days .

u - 5 at crown street and u - 6 at the end of the line where ship channel loop
3026 line ties into the shell west 4792 line .
it is my understanding that the following customers within this outage
section currently take gas :
air products meter 1418
albemarle meter 1188
the current schedule would call for an outage to start on 4 / 13 / 00 and be back

the pipeline outage time mentioned in the memo below needs to be revised .
actual construction time should be 7 days and pipeline outage time should be
3 days max . this outage time , which is longer than the norm , is due to the
fact that we will have to remove the existing line and replace it in the same
ditch before tie ins take place .
as an update , the first train is now scheduled to cross late today . they now
say that it may take 4 weeks to get all the trains in and out before we are
able to begin replacing our line .
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
i have been advised by the deer park rr representative , dean truitt , that
the rail cars will begin arriving on 3 / 15 / 00 .
per our conversations today , please have someone on tuesday 3 / 13 adjust the
regulators at simpson and at shell deer park so that 280 psig is the maximum
pressure in that pipeline section .
i will maintain contact with deer park on the duration of this project and
keep you informed . it is likely that the duration of the pressure reduction
will be on the order of 2 weeks .
after the initial 700 rail cars have entered and exited their facility , deer
park will remove their railroad bed and allow us to perform a pipeline
replacement at that location . this replacement would involve an outage on
this segment of pipeline for approximately 7 days . i would anticipate that
this outage would occur in early april .
thanks for your cooperation in this matter .

transaction has not been scheduled correctly . there are two deal tickets in

the gas to hplc for hplc to transport on tejas . deal # 213370 covers the
transport usage on tejas from oasis katy to laporte . i have edited this
ticket to add the $ . 02 / mm charge . there needs to be a tejas expense contract

i ' m not sure what ' s going on , but i did not see a teco deal ticket in mops
for houston pipeline company anywhere ( january 1999 to march 1999 ) . i did
see one on houston pipeline company resources .
as my original note stated , i think this is a buy / sell which means that teco
gas processing should appear in both the market and supply depending on
hplc ' s position .
please let me know something asap .

george ,
at the 9 th workday meeting you had asked if we had seen the paper on the
above referenced . i have checked our database , and it appears that we have
not . the contract in the system does reflect at gs at this point .
i also checked on teco gas processing company , and it does not appear we have
seen the paper on this one either .

just so everyone is on the same page :
based on jennifer and dale ' s discussions with eric bass , a new " tokenized
period " will be set up in eol . the intent of this period ( quick overview ) is
to allow for gas flow monday through friday and no flow on the weekends .
this will generally be traded for in full month or rest of the month
increments .
it is my understanding the although the trade can be conveyed correctly to
the customer and priced accordingly using eol , the trade itself ( with
multiple monday - friday , no flow during weekend periods ) cannot be handled
internally by eol . just as eol is not able to handle this trade , the sitara
bridge from eol cannot handle this trade . because of this , there should be
heighten attention by trade capture given to the eol bridge monitor . these
trades will error out and will have to be entered manually .
an effort needs to be evaluated and prioritized by both applications ( eol and
sitara ) on how a deal with multi - periods can flow without human
intervention . this has not been started . in the meantime , a deal of this
nature will have to be entered manually .
how do i know that a particular deal has multi - period flow ? once the eol
product has been set up , jennifer and / or dale will let all involved know .
the person ( s ) responsible for entering the deal will have to understand what
is meant by the eol product ' s delivery period and enter the deal
accordingly .
for example , assume that a deal has been traded for april :
four delivery periods ( separate lines ) should be included in the sitara
ticket
start : 04 / 03 stop : 04 / 07
04 / 10 04 / 14
04 / 17 04 / 21
04 / 24 04 / 28
each delivery period ( line ) should have the same pricing
remember to enter the eol deal number when creating the sitara trade .
also remember that paths created in unify assume the stop date is open
ended . every effort needs to be made to make sure the appropriate end date
is on the path ; otherwise
the number of reconciling items will increase .
please forward this information to anyone else you think might be impacted .
any concerns , please contact sheri thomas or myself .

utilization
in order to provide the ability to track transport expense by desk , sitara
was modified to allow multiple transport capacity tickets for the same
service contract provided that they are for different desks and only one is
tagged as " primary " . here is the procedure for setting up new capacity
tickets to reflect the " other " desks :
a . you will probably first notice this via a warning / error message in path
manager when building a new path . the message will read something like
" source / destination 123456 for desk imct does not match service contract 3434
and will be removed . "
b . make note of the deal number in the service list of the service contract
that you were using in the new path .
c . open that transport capacity deal in sitara . then hit copy .
d . on the new deal :
change the buyer from the old desk to the new desk that matches the supply
or market deal that you are pathing with . if it a contract for which we are
agent , then don ' t change the buyer but instead change the agent to the new
desk . the " primary " deal will carry the actual agent .
changing the buyer causes the contract field to get blanked out . re - select
the contract .
just above the various exchange line items is a primary deal check box .
un - check it .
on each exchange line item , change the mdq to zero and for any negotiated
rates , uncheck them as well . the " primary " deal will carry the mdq and
any negotiated demand , commodity or fuel .
hit release .
e . you may need to re - retrieve path manager . you should see the deal number
in the service list now read " multiple " . right - click / service deals will list
the specific deals .
f . re - build the path as you originally desired . the warning / error message
should not appear again .
this could occur for any combination of desk and service contract .
please file this in your " call dave if i can ' t find this " folder .

dec . ) and 3 / 23 ( 35 dec . ) but the deal ( sitara # 213005 ) doesn ' t cover these

can you see if it is feasible to activate these two days in sitara so that i

3 - 9497Subject: march surveys
hello ,
we have prepared january and february data and will be scheduling meetings
with you in the next few weeks . for the month of march , please provide a
completed " hours " survey for each position within your group . this survey
will collect the time your team spent on performing their activities in the
month of march .
note : we are now collecting eol related activities . if you spend time
directly supporting eol , and your survey does not have an activity that you
can assign these times to , please contact me as soon as possible so we can
add the appropriate activities to your survey .
to fill out the survey :
at the top of the spreadsheet , you will see a box labelled " select your rc " .
click on the box and input your rc number , which will need to be 4 digits .
once you have done this , another box will appear with the message " select
position from drop box ! " you can then select the position ( i . e . , staff ,
specialist , etc . ) and " ok " . the choices for positions are based on
information contained in the org database ( i . e . , if a position is not listed
that should be , please call me to discuss as it would indicate that
corrections need to be made to the database ) . once you have the list of
activities , please input hours ( for the entire month ) for each activity
listed in the column labelled " hours " .
if you ' re filling out the survey for your team , save a file for each of the
positions you fill out for your team prior to filling out the next position .
if you do not , the information will be lost .
we have included february compiled hours per position ( if you had two
specialists performing the same activity - 20 hours each , the " last month "
column would show a total of 40 hrs for that month ) . as with last month , you
have the option to complete the survey on behalf of your entire group or send
this survey to each of your team members , allowing each individual to fill
out the time they spent on each activity . if there are any activities you
perform not included in your survey , please contact me as soon as possible
for a copy of the activity dictionary .
please return these surveys by end of day wednesday , april 5 th . if this is a
problem , please notify me or lisa cousino immediately .
thanks ,
shari
3 - 3859Subject: march activity survey
as you are aware , we are starting to collect data for our march price model .
i ' ve attached a survey to help us collect the data that will be driving your
costs from the activities to the commercial teams . in the ' data ' tab , please
select the your rcs , and fill in the driver quantity for the requested driver
for the month of february . please fill out the attached activity driver
survey with march numbers for your rc by end of day wednesday , april 5 th . if
your group currently generates a standard report that captures the surveyed
data , please send the report to me , and put me on your recipient list
beginning next month . this will eliminate your need to fill out this survey
every month . if you would like us to collect this information from someone
within your team beginning next month , please let me know .
please take this opportunity to verify the following :
1 . the driver indicates a measure for the time and effort your team spent to
perform these activities for each commercial team .
2 . the activity is spent in support of the commercial teams identified
( please let us know otherwise )
3 . if the activity is using an allocation ( for example " allocate 0469 " or
" 80 - 20 split " ) , that the percentage allocated to each commercial team has not
changed from last month . ( please let us know if it has changed what the new
allocation is ) .
in reference to these surveys , please note :
if you are allocating only infrastructure costs to some commercial teams
listed in the survey , please identify them . we will take your business
support costs ( such as feedback , training , etc . ) and allocate them evenly
among these teams .
the costs for " commercial team specific " activities that you filled time out
for in the january time survey will be directly allocated to that commercial
team ( e . g . genco support will trace 100 % of its costs to genco ) .
please let us know if you have any questions on this survey .
regards ,
shari

subject : gap certificates
hey guys , i finally found one that is true ! i went down to the
gap myself and redeemed my gift certificates already ! ! ! i sent
enough e - mails to get over two hundred dollars worth of clothes from
the gap ! you know , with all the crap sent over the mail , it is good to
know that something finally rings true in this environment of virtual
deception . send it to everyone you know , and you too can have a whole new
wardrobe , courtesy of the gap ! isn ' t it grand ?
hi ! my name is janelle mccan , founder of the gap .
you have probably heard about the e - mail from abercrombie and fitch offering
twenty five dollar gift certificates to every five people you sent that
letter to . my question is : did it work ? most of you who tried it will
probably say no .
but this letter is not prank like others you have experienced . i am offering
thirty five dollar gift certificates to every seven people you send this to .
when you have finished sending this letter to as many people as you wish , a
screen will come up . it will tell you how much you have earned in gap gift
certificates . print that screen out and bring it to your local gap store .
the sales clerk will give you your certificates and you can shop baby ! this
is a sales promotion to get our name out to young people around the world .
we
believe this project can be a success , but only with your help .
thank you for your support !
sincerely ,
janelle mccan

i know it ' s first of the month but the above meter has flow for 3 / 15 ( 71
dec . ) and 3 / 23 ( 35 dec . ) but the deal ( sitara # 213005 ) doesn ' t cover these

utilization - revised
revision in bold . pass on to any who may need this .
in order to provide the ability to track transport expense by desk , sitara
was modified to allow multiple transport capacity tickets for the same
service contract provided that they are for different desks and only one is
tagged as " primary " . here is the procedure for setting up new capacity
tickets to reflect the " other " desks :
a . you will probably first notice this via a warning / error message in path
manager when building a new path . the message will read something like
" source / destination 123456 for desk imct does not match service contract 3434
and will be removed . "
b . make note of the deal number in the service list of the service contract
that you were using in the new path .
c . open that transport capacity deal in sitara . then hit copy .
d . on the new deal :
change the buyer from the old desk to the new desk that matches the supply
or market deal that you are pathing with . if it a deal for which we are
agent , then don ' t change the buyer but instead change the agent to the new
desk . the " primary " deal will carry the actual agent . the agent
contract will get cleared . re - select the agent contract .
changing the buyer causes the contract field to get blanked out . re - select
the pipeline contract .
just above the various exchange line items is a primary deal check box .
un - check it .
on each exchange line item , change the mdq to zero and for any negotiated
rates , uncheck them as well . the " primary " deal will carry the mdq and
any negotiated demand , commodity or fuel .
hit release .
e . you may need to re - retrieve path manager . you should see the deal number
in the service list now read " multiple " . right - click / service deals will list
the specific deals .
f . re - build the path as you originally desired . the warning / error message
should not appear again .
this could occur for any combination of desk and service contract .
please file this in your " call dave if i can ' t find this " folder .

volume management should be fine with this change . all name changes will be
still attached to the original path of the buy / sell deal . the settlement
group will have to make sure that the new name that is being added to the
deal has the appropriate ' statement group ' attached . other than that this
change should flow smoothly .

fyi . . . .
this change went in for the deal validation group . it gives them the
ability to change counterparties names after bridge back .
impact to logistics - unify
if a counterparty name change takes place to deals that have been bridge
backed , it could cause problems on edi pipes as that new counterparty name
will flow over to unify and repathing should eventually take place .
one problem may be with the imbalance data sets , which are not in production
yet . . . . . . ( edi imbalance qtys would not match up to paths )
this may also cause an issue with the scheduled quantities ( especially where
nominations were sent for entire month )
can ' t remember the rules on this one , but i think unify does have some safe
guards ( idiot proofs ) to force re - pathing .
unify does have the ability to over - ride duns numbers , yet would still cause
an additional step for edi the scheduler would need to think through in order
to get a clean quick response .
what are ( if any ) impacts to vol mgt if counterparty name changes take
place ? ( prior periods ? re - pathing ? )
i have a call into diane and dave both . after speaking w / them , hopefully i
can get a clear understanding of the true impact . i am sure we ' ll need to
put some processes and procedures together for deal validation to follow when
these type of changes are needed .

subject : sitara release ( re : changes in global due to consent to assignment )
regarding the ability to change counterparties on deals in sitara with
confirmed volumes - tom ' s words of caution :
if someone calls you and wants to change a counterparty - we created the
ability for you to invalidate the deal - and
then change the counterparty - however - i did add a warning message :
" warning - changing counterparty on deal with confirmed volumes - make sure
pipeline allows this change . "
some pipelines do not allow us to change counterparties after there is
feedback - i assume for the same reasons
we had this rule - it used to blow up our old scheduling systems
( pre - unify ) . some pipelines will require a new
deal and we will have to zero out the old deal .
before you make the change - make sure the logistics person is aware - just
in case it causes problems with their
pipeline . sorry - i don ' t know which pipes these are - you will have to ask
the unify team .
there is one rule still in place - you can change from ena - im east to ena - im
market east - but not from
ena - im texas to hplc - im hplc - when changing business units - they must be
the same legal entity .
" warning - not the same legal entity "
also - beware of making contract and counterparty changes to service deals
( transport capacity , storage , cash out ) .
once the deal is invalidated - there are no rules . don ' t forget - the items
were locked down for a reason .
if you invalidate a service deal - and change the previously locked down
data that was validated - and someone used these
deals in unify - it is highly likely that the unify deals and paths created
using these deals will get corrupted . always check
with someone from unify to make sure no one used these deals for anything in
unify .

changing counterparty names on sitara deal tickets has absolutely no impact
to any downstream processes .
i hope the following will give more clarification .
let me know if you have any questions or need more detail !
thanks ,

sitara / unify - process
* scenario - counterparty name changes on sitara deal ticket after deal had
been pathed , scheduled & bridged back from unify .
* impact - zero impact to logistics & volume management , absolutely
harmless . settlements has process in place to eliminate issues .
* process -
counterparty a in sitara changes to counterparty b .
ctprty a was on original path sent to pipeline .
the new name ( ctprty b ) does bridge over to unify .
ctprty a remains at the path level in unify ( gui display does not change )
ctprty b is now displayed at the deal level in unify . the field is now
highlighted to indicate a change occurred . ( gui display changes only at high
level , not on path )
the scheduler has choice to repath ( if necessary ) , or not re - path
if re - pathing occurs , the new counterparty name will be displaced on new path
unify pushes back the deal number & meter to sitara ( not ctprty info )
balancing works on deal number & meter only ( not ctprty info )
the confirmation desk utilizes the information in sitara ( where all
information is correct )
volume management utilizes the information in unify for pipeline tie - out .
( all information sent to pipeline is correct at the path level and will match
up perfectly )
settlements utilizes information in unify .
settlements recognizes that changed ctprty names changes contracts , which
would create two notification entries
if invoice did happen to go out to wrong ctprty , re - draft would occur .
( note : there was an issues discovered on reports which it is correcting now )
autonoms " tom ' s words of warning " -
previously there was an issue when counterparty name changes took place after
deals were pathed and nominated . basically it would change a key on an edi
path ( duns number ) not affecting any other of the information already
nominated to the pipeline . if the scheduler re - nominated , data at the
pipeline would get doubled up and the scheduler would have no way to correct
the problem . in most cases , the schedulers would have to get the pipeline to
manually cut the original nominated volume . this is not an issue with unify
( as explained above ) .

fyi . . . .
this change went in for the deal validation group . it gives them the
ability to change counterparties names after bridge back .
impact to logistics - unify
if a counterparty name change takes place to deals that have been bridge
backed , it could cause problems on edi pipes as that new counterparty name
will flow over to unify and repathing should eventually take place .
one problem may be with the imbalance data sets , which are not in production
yet . . . . . . ( edi imbalance qtys would not match up to paths )
this may also cause an issue with the scheduled quantities ( especially where
nominations were sent for entire month )
can ' t remember the rules on this one , but i think unify does have some safe
guards ( idiot proofs ) to force re - pathing .
unify does have the ability to over - ride duns numbers , yet would still cause
an additional step for edi the scheduler would need to think through in order
to get a clean quick response .
what are ( if any ) impacts to vol mgt if counterparty name changes take
place ? ( prior periods ? re - pathing ? )
i have a call into diane and dave both . after speaking w / them , hopefully i
can get a clear understanding of the true impact . i am sure we ' ll need to
put some processes and procedures together for deal validation to follow when
these type of changes are needed .
will keep you posted .
thanks ,

subject : sitara release ( re : changes in global due to consent to assignment )
regarding the ability to change counterparties on deals in sitara with
confirmed volumes - tom ' s words of caution :
if someone calls you and wants to change a counterparty - we created the
ability for you to invalidate the deal - and
then change the counterparty - however - i did add a warning message :
" warning - changing counterparty on deal with confirmed volumes - make sure
pipeline allows this change . "
some pipelines do not allow us to change counterparties after there is
feedback - i assume for the same reasons
we had this rule - it used to blow up our old scheduling systems
( pre - unify ) . some pipelines will require a new
deal and we will have to zero out the old deal .
before you make the change - make sure the logistics person is aware - just
in case it causes problems with their
pipeline . sorry - i don ' t know which pipes these are - you will have to ask
the unify team .
there is one rule still in place - you can change from ena - im east to ena - im
market east - but not from
ena - im texas to hplc - im hplc - when changing business units - they must be
the same legal entity .
" warning - not the same legal entity "
also - beware of making contract and counterparty changes to service deals
( transport capacity , storage , cash out ) .
once the deal is invalidated - there are no rules . don ' t forget - the items
were locked down for a reason .
if you invalidate a service deal - and change the previously locked down
data that was validated - and someone used these
deals in unify - it is highly likely that the unify deals and paths created
using these deals will get corrupted . always check
with someone from unify to make sure no one used these deals for anything in
unify .

subject : sitara release ( re : changes in global due to consent to assignment )
with the release that was put out tuesday evening , deal validation should be
able to change the counterparty on deals where the volume is something other
than expected ( e . g . confirmed , nominated , scheduled , etc . ) .
in addition , this release will also capture " near - time " the contract changes
that are made in global . this means that need for server bounces will not be
necessary .
new / changes to contracts will show up without having to get out of deal
manager .
new counterparties , and new / changes to facilities will require getting out
of all active sitara apps ( except for launch pad ) .
once out of all apps , start a new app - the respective information that you
are looking for will appear .
i mention " near - time " because we are constrained by the amount of time it
takes for the change in global data to trigger an alert for sitara who then
updates its information

we believe that the competitive success of enrononline is due to one very
specific reason . in addition to providing a web - based platform for
transactions , enron acts as principal to provide direct liquidity to the
site . we stand ready at all times , in any market conditions , to buy and sell
at the posted price . this converts a  & bulletin board  8 ( the more typical
ecommerce concept ) into a true market . there are very few , if any ,
competitors that can provide this capability .
we are increasingly convinced that this competitive advantage can be
dramatically expanded to other products and other geographies . if we are
correct , this could provide an enormous new opportunity for growth for enron .
accordingly , we are initiating a major new effort to capture this
opportunity . effective today we are creating a new business , enron net
works , to pursue new market development opportunities in ecommerce across a
broad range of industries . it is likely that this business will ultimately
be our fifth business segment , joining transmission mike
mcconnell , chief operating officer ; and jeff mcmahon , chief commercial
officer . these individuals will comprise the office of the chairman for
enron net works and remain on the executive committee of enron corp .
replacing greg whalley as president and chief operating officer of enron
north america is dave delainey , who will also join enron  , s executive
committee .
global technology will remain intact but will now be a part of enron net
works . it will maintain all of the same businesses and services as it did as
an enron global function . philippe bibi will remain the chief technology
officer for all of enron corp . and continues to be responsible for the
development of worldwide technology standards and platforms .
enrononline , headed by louise kitchen , will also remain intact and will now
be a part of enron net works . the success of enrononline enables us to
utilize this site as a model as we explore other markets . in addition , the
following individuals are included in enron net works along with their
current ecommerce initiatives : harry arora , public financial securities ; jay
fitzgerald , new markets identification ; bruce garner , metals ; and greg piper ,
pulp and paper .
over the next several weeks we will complete staffing and organizational
design and will provide full details on this exciting new business
opportunity .Subject: re : equistar deal tickets

i need to have these tickets set up so the excess volumes will be priced
correctly in unify . currently unify is adding all excess volume for each day
and pricing the first 10 , 000 at a certain price and anything over 10 , 000 at a
different price . for example meter 1553 may have 5000 on the first , meter
1384 may have 5000 , and meter 1552 may have 5000 . unify currently prices the
first 10 , 000 at a certain price , and 5000 at a different price . this is
incorrect because none of the meters exceeded 10 , 000 , each meter should be
priced at the first tier level . robert needs to set up one additional sale
ticket and one additional buyback ticket , but he will not schedule gas to
these tickets . anita luong will move the volumes to the correct ticket when
she allocates the volumes each month . equistar receives manual invoices each
month because they need to see the sale and the buyback on the same invoice ,
and they also need to have each meter invoiced separately . i need to have
these tickets set up to clean up my unify draft invoices .

agreement
thanks for the info !
as greg mentioned in the staff meeting today , the intent is that this
restructured deal is papered effective 4 / 1 / 00 . the impact is potentially
that the gas is not pathed properly by counterparty or on the appropriate
transport / gathering agreements , etc . if any rates are changing , then those
need to be changed in our systems also . there may be other areas of changes
also - i ' m not attempting to list them all . rather i just want to make
people aware that retroactive deals can have impacts on the daily operations .

from : celestedeo @ aol . com
sent : tuesday , april 11 , 2000 1 : 21 pm
subject : special prayer request
hi ,
i am coming to you with a very special prayer request . we have some good
friends here in nashville , mark and melanie burress and their one year old
baby gracie , who have recently received some devastating news . mark was
diagnosed in december with leukemia . his is normally a very slow spreading
form of the disease but unfortunately his is spreading extremely fast . he
also has a rare dna type and only about 12 people on the bone marrow donor
list ( out of 4 . 5 million ) were possible matches and all have since been
elimnated . we held a bone marrow drive in his behalf at church this past
weekend and over 1200 people came to donate . this amazed the people running
the drive because they said they normally get a few hundred at the most .
if a donor is not found by june his chances are very , very slim to live to
july . he has chosen to have his bone marrow transplant in houston at the
anderson hospital so i am asking if there is anyone in houston who knows of
a
strong , supportive congregation near the hospital that they may attend ( when
possible ) while they are there , that would be greatly appreciated . if a
donor is located , they say the transplant procedure is very difficult and he
won ' t be able to have any contact with his baby for several months due to
his
immune system being weakened . as you can imagine , this would put his wife
in
a severe state of limbo , having to be primary caregiver to someone who is
incapacitated and a baby without the two being able to be together .
it is difficult to watch someone with so much to give and so much to live
for
to be facing such a hard fight . please keep his family in your prayers and
i
know if there is a miracle with marks ' name on it , god will provide it .
if you could please pass this on to the chi sigs / regina list , every little
prayer they get will be appreciated .
thank you !

i just spoke briefly with brian riley , who is working to restructure the knig
ranch contracts with exxon , and put coastal into the loop . yesterday i
forwarded each of you an e - mail from steve van hooser which had drafts of
contracts attached . as i talked with brian , the king ranch set up as he is
negotiating will be simplified . the intent , as i understood it , is that we
will no longer buy at the wellhead . rather , coastal is entering into a a
gathering agreement with hpl to buy at the wellhead and ship to the plant .
hplc will buy at the tailgate of the plant , net of pvr . so there will not be
future settlements with exxon on liquids . the paper has not been returned
from coastal or exxon yet , but the deal is effective 4 / 1 / 00 . everything will
be under new agreements , with receipts and deliveries by different
counterparties . the gas flow continues the same , just under new contracts
and different counterparties .
daren , pat and stella : daren , brian said he would get with you to discuss
the deal in further detail . please include pat and stella in the discussion
also . the contracts should be reviewed and understood to ensure proper
scheduling . as i mentioned to greg sharp and brian , it is critical that we
be kept in the loop , especially on retroactive deals , as scheduling ,
transport rates and risk are affected .

jackie :
meter 5688 is incorrectly scheduled to the hpl liquids contract
012 - 41970 - 02 - 002 in march 2000 . also last month when you were out , robert
removed the volume from the liquids contract at this meter and temporarily
put it on a strangers gas contract . if you could fix both months today and
let me know when it is corrected i would appreciate it .
thanks ,

meters 5688 and 5801 are not scheduled on the hpl liquids contract

volume at these two meters so if you could fix this by early tomorrow morning
i would appreciate it .

are not , could you please let me know who i need to speak to .
for meter # 78033 and # 78032 for 3 / 00 production forward , this deal is set

is
sitara # 156387 ( for meter # 78033 ) and sitara # 156383 ( for meter # 78032

fredSubject: re : pg & e texas meeting
recap of pg & e texas meeting 4 / 12 / 00 .
volume issues :
? sherlyn schumack will provide stacey neuweiler with volume variances by day
and contract as soon as possible ( preferably the same day allocation is
received ) .
? stacey will notify sherlyn of correct volume or status if further research
is necessary as soon as possible .
? sherlyn will notify logistics , stacey , and lorraine of pg & e texas of
interconnect variances by day .
? each group will respond promptly to ensure payment can be made through the
system , eliminating manual line items on invoice .
? charlotte hawkins will see what was confirmed on the outstanding
interconnect issue for 2 / 00 , and daren or charlotte will make the necessary
correction .
rate issues :
? heidi withers will pull daily rates from pg & e texas bulletin board .
? greg steagall will provide heidi with service verification ( s ) and the daily
allocation summary received from pg & e texas during close , which shows rates
from pg & e texas .
? no action will be taken on rate variances where pg & e was paid per their
invoice . heidi has talked with brenda herod , and brenda is okay with this
course of action .
? there are four invoices from 1999 production where pg & e was underpaid , so
heidi and greg will work to correct those months to pay pg & e correctly .
there are no open invoices in settlements .
? it was noted that manual line items are not to be used to pay pg & e per
their invoice in the future . we expect to correct issues in the system prior
to the due date of the invoice unless there is a valid disagreement between
ena and pg & e . if ena has a valid disagreement , we will pay per ena  , s
verification .
daren has put in a request for legal to transfer the ena transport contracts
to hpl . this would eliminate stacey having to schedule the transport on ena
as well as the desk to desk deal . it would also prevent sherlyn from having
to allocate the transport expense contract and the brokered desk to desk
deal .
he has not had a response from legal yet .Subject: re : brandywine meter # : 981225 ; march , 2000 activity
just to set the record straight , measurement was not contacted nor informed
that the recorded flow was inaccurate . we are dependent on the field to
verify measurement information , and absent information to the contrary , the
recorded volumes were published . the hms technician , charlie speigel , was
contacted today , and this issue was discussed and verified that he
neglected to notify gms of the erroneous recorded flow . we will correct the
statements to reflect zero flow based on this discussion .

hi daren ,
i ' m attempting to clear the above mentioned meter from an error report
( revenue volume comparison report ) . howard apprised me , in a meeting last
week , that the reason this meter is appearing in the aforementioned report is
due to no volumes being scheduled in pops but volumes appearing in mops . the
volumes @ this meter is for 4449 ( sitara deal tickets 240095 and 227697 . due
to this being a " check meter " the volumes will not bridge to pops from mops .
i ' d like to request to revise the nome of 4449 to show " 0 " instead . can you
approve this modification ?

subject : resume for summer internship
april 20 , 2000
dear mr . mcconnell :
thank you for taking the time to consider this resume for a possible summer
internship with enron . i understand that you have spoken to my father , scott
wells at texaco , and he has informed me that enron accepts interns only when
a department asks for one .
i ' d like to continue my education in the energy industry for a second summer .
i interned for dynegy last summer and learned many new concepts and terms
for working in the gas industry . i worked on the trading floor as a gas
scheduler , and after only a month i was controlling the northeast cng
pipeline . this helped because i really got to learn were many of the
northeast pipes are located and different pooling and connecting points .
other responsibilities were inputting numbers into the morning spreadsheet of
the gas bought and sold that morning . throughout the day i would work on
projects they needed completed and attend meetings that pertained to the
trading floor . it was all a great learning experience for me and i hope to
use my knowledge again this summer for enron .
i would appreciate your help in forwarding my resume to the proper human
resource personnel so that i might be able to contact him or her in hopes of
a future internship possibility . i will be available to have a start date of
may 15 th and be available for employment until school resumes in late august .
thank you for your time , and i look forward to hearing from someone in your
company at his / her earliest convenience . please feel free to call me at
940 - 323 - 0891 , or email me at rollins 50 @ aol . com .
sincerely -

subject : bridgeline workorder
i have some information on the e - workorders ( ehurr and ehset ) that were set
up to track the costs of bridgeline . apparently the workorders themselves
were not set up correctly so no costs could be coded to them in msa . we have
corrected the workorder set - ups and they should be working now . as for prior
costs , i think we will be able to get a list of all the payroll costs that we
attempted to code to ehurr and ehset , and then book an entry in april that
would reclass them to the workorders . we would then be able to see all the
costs associated with the project , as you wanted to do from the beginning ,
and code any future costs directly to the workorders . i will let you know
more when i finalize that this can really be done , i just wanted to keep you
updated on the progress .
if you have any questions , please let me know .
thanks ,

subject : unify performance problem on wednesday
as you are aware , the unify system experienced significant performance
problems wednesday from approx 9 : 30 am - 11 : 20 am . the duration of the
problem was due to a type of system behavior we had not experienced before .
the problem was exacerbated by a multitude of additional user logins thinking
that a fresh login might work better . additional logins never improve
performance and generally degrade it , but that is another story . ( there was
actually a single user with 21 sessions ! ) we had to " bounce " the server
twice to bring the system back to its normal level of performance .
the good news is that we found out what caused the problem . it was not a
particular user or a particular report or process . it was actually an
intentional change to a specific table that we have done numerous times in
the past , but this particular change had drastic side effects . we have
contacted sybase with this problem to see if they can help determine if the
behavior is a " feature " or a bug . in the meanwhile , we will do these types
of changes at night during scheduled outages .
i apologize for the frustration , anxiety , and extra work brought on by this
problem and will take every precaution to see that it does not happen again .
if you have any further questions or comments , please feel free to give me a
call .

feedback system ) . you will be receiving your password for this system in a
note to go out later from pep . in preparation for the cycle , four training
classes will be offered to all new employees and to those employees who have
not previously attended training . enrollment for these classes will be
offered through the development center " ernie " system . for employees who are
outside the houston area , please contact your hr representative for more
information .

all sessions will be held at the doubletree hotel .
to register , click on this link to go directly to the development center
for those of you who have attended the training before and who are familiar
with the past performance management process , there have been some
modifications :
1 . the performance management process is now enron wide . all enron feedback
forms have been reduced to three ( vice president ( vp ) / managing director
( md ) ; management / professional ; and administration / support ) , which all use
the following criteria :
? innovation / entrepreneurship
? communication / setting direction
? teamwork / interpersonal
? leadership / vision / values
? business instinct
? analytical / technical
2 . the following six performance ratings will be used consistently on the
final feedback forms across enron :
superior
excellent
strong
satisfactory
needs improvement
issues
3 . there will be four recognized peer groups across the company for purposes
of the prc ( formerly the business review meetings ) meeting .
? commercial
? commercial support
? technical
? specialized technical
4 . the performance review process will continue to be used to facilitate :
? promotions - up to director level only . there will be no officer promotions
to vp / md at mid - year
? feedback to employee
? compensation decisions
? sharing of performance rating at manager  , s discretion
5 . prc meetings will be reviewed by both functional area & business units
both functional areas and business units will participate in the rating of
employees to cover both solid and dotted line reporting relationships .
functional prc meetings will take place first , followed by the final business
unit meetings . difference in views on an individual employee  , s rating should
be discussed and consensus should be reached . the functional area meetings
are :
- accounting
- human resources
- government affairs
- rac
- global finance
6 . the pep system is now available via the intranet to allow greater access
from global locations and remotely . the functionality is essentially the
same . if you would like further information on how to use this system you may
gain access to the quick reference guide by clicking on the attached
weblinkhttp : / / home . enron . com / announce / . pdf . if the
quick reference does not display correctly on your pc , call your help desk
for assistance , or irma alvarez at 713 - 853 - 1543 to get a hard copy .
7 . the general responsibilities remain the same regarding the overall
process :
employee / reviewer responsibilities :
select 5 - 7 reviewers
complete self - assessment
complete requested feedback forms
reviewers who cannot provide feedback use the decline request feature
supervisor responsibilities :
approve reviewers ( at least 3 of the employee ' s choices )
communicate modifications to employee
participate in prc meetings as required
summarize feedback and complete appropriate feedback form
communicate feedback to the employee
schedule for mid - year performance review

i am working on a project for brenda herod & was wondering if one of you
could tell me if i ' m on the right track & if this will get everything for
which she is looking .
she is trying to draft a long - term transport / storage agreement between ena &
hplc which will allow ena to move the gas to their markets . in order to
accomplish this , she needs to know all of the sales to customers that ena is
doing off of hpl ' s pipe .
i had scott mills run a report from sitara showing all ena buy / sell activity
on hpl since 7 / 99 . if i eliminate the buys & the desk - to - desk deals , will
this give me everything that i need ?
are there buy / sell deals done with ena on hpl ' s pipe that wouldn ' t show up in
sitara ? someone mentioned something about deals where hpl transports the gas
on it ' s own behalf then ena sells it to a customer at that same spot - -
? ? ? ? ? do deals like that happen ? would they show up in sitara ?
is there anything else that i ' m missing ? i ' m not real familiar with how some
of these deals happen nowadays so am very receptive to any
ideas / suggestions / help that you can offer ! ! !

subject : ena sales on hpl
i am working on a project for brenda herod & was wondering if one of you
could tell me if i ' m on the right track & if this will get everything for
which she is looking .
she is trying to draft a long - term transport / storage agreement between ena &
hplc which will allow ena to move the gas to their markets . in order to
accomplish this , she needs to know all of the sales to customers that ena is
doing off of hpl ' s pipe .
i had scott mills run a report from sitara showing all ena buy / sell activity
on hpl since 7 / 99 . if i eliminate the buys & the desk - to - desk deals , will
this give me everything that i need ?
are there buy / sell deals done with ena on hpl ' s pipe that wouldn ' t show up in
sitara ? someone mentioned something about deals where hpl transports the gas
on it ' s own behalf then ena sells it to a customer at that same spot - -
? ? ? ? ? do deals like that happen ? would they show up in sitara ?
is there anything else that i ' m missing ? i ' m not real familiar with how some
of these deals happen nowadays so am very receptive to any
ideas / suggestions / help that you can offer ! ! !
thanks in advance .Subject: houston gas & power controls / standards assessment

subject : houston gas & power controls / standards assessment
as you all are aware , there is a heightened awareness throughout the company
of the need for establishing global trading control standards and developing
a process by which we will track and monitor on a regular basis our success
at achieving those standards . i have been asked by sally to take the lead on
meeting this objective . for the last several weeks , i have been involved in
an extensive review of the london office controls and procedures for their
gas and power trading businesses . we have used the findings of this review
to start developing an assessment of controls , standards and measurement
methodology for the london office .
in order to work towards our goal of developing global trading standards
across enron , we need to perform the same controls and standards assessment
for the houston gas and power businesses ( we will assess global products and
other commodities traded at a later date ) . i will be in houston tuesday and
wednesday of next week to help facilitate this process .
i have scheduled a meeting next weds . , may 17 from 9 : 00 - 11 : 30 in eb 49 cl so
that we may review our controls , define the standards of meeting those
control requirements and assess the risk associated with those controls not
operating properly . before that meeting , i would like for all of you to
develop for your respective functional responsibilities the following :
- a listing of all controls your group is responsible for ( i . e . cash
collections are timely )
- a proposed standard that will ensure each control is being met to its
maximum effectiveness ( i . e . cash is collected within 30 days of deal date
with exceptions noted )
- a quantitative measure to allow performance monitoring of each standard
( i . e . % of cash collected within 30 days )
- a description of current capabilities to calculate , track and report each
measurement ( i . e . automated a / r aging report )
i would urge you to be as detailed as possible in listing your control
functions and to solicit feedback from your managers and leads . a lot of
work has already been done to identify this information so i would hope time
requirements for this will not be extensive . i have attached a worksheet to
be completed with the information discussed above . i have also attached a
high level summary of proposed gas and power standards to use a guideline but
it is certainly not all - inclusive and should be revised as necessary .
as discussed above , we will review the controls and standards listings for
each functional group in the weds . meeting and also assess the risk
associated with each control . i would like to achieve consensus on gas and
power operating standards for houston by the end of the meeting . let me know
if you have any questions or comments regarding this process . i look forward
to seeing you next week .Subject: mid year prc meeting
i would like to have our prc meeting on thursday , 6 / 8 . because of trading ,

subject : ena sales on hpl
i am working on a project for brenda herod & was wondering if one of you
could tell me if i ' m on the right track & if this will get everything for
which she is looking .
she is trying to draft a long - term transport / storage agreement between ena &
hplc which will allow ena to move the gas to their markets . in order to
accomplish this , she needs to know all of the sales to customers that ena is
doing off of hpl ' s pipe .
i had scott mills run a report from sitara showing all ena buy / sell activity
on hpl since 7 / 99 . if i eliminate the buys & the desk - to - desk deals , will
this give me everything that i need ?
are there buy / sell deals done with ena on hpl ' s pipe that wouldn ' t show up in
sitara ? someone mentioned something about deals where hpl transports the gas
on it ' s own behalf then ena sells it to a customer at that same spot - -
? ? ? ? ? do deals like that happen ? would they show up in sitara ?
is there anything else that i ' m missing ? i ' m not real familiar with how some
of these deals happen nowadays so am very receptive to any
ideas / suggestions / help that you can offer ! ! !

this product will be for physical delivery only on the weekdays ( no weekend

we are rolling out the use of the 24 x 5 nat gas product commencing tomorrow ,
may 24 th .
the product is a month - long physical nat gas product traded off the texas
desk . it will be identified as follows :
us gas phy exxon katy wkd juno 0 usd / mm
this product is different from the usual products traded on the texas desk in
that the product description has an
indicator of wkd , which designates that the product only moves gas on a day
that is a monday , tuesday , wednesday ,
thursday or friday .
these products will not bridge into sitara . risk personnel will need to be
diligent to identify these products based
on the information in the product description to ensure that the products are
entered into sitara correctly ( presumably -
strips of monday - friday trades and the corresponding month - starting days
and / or month - ending days ) .
we understand the potential impact of having to manually input these
transactions and have asked the appropriate
systems personnel to examine the links between eol and sitara and consider
building bridge capability . in the
interim , we anticipate that the trading volume on these products will be low ,
and will ask for higher prioritization of the
bridging in the event that volumes increase .

subject : re : ena sales on hpl
daren - thank you for the list of the true , remaining ena sales customers . i
have been researching your list & getting the contractual volumes that brenda
needs . i am confused about praxair though .
the sales contract between ena & praxair was assigned to hplc eff / 10 / 1 / 99 .
the only remaining contract between ena & praxair is a master financial
agreement .
does praxair really need to remain under ena or is it okay under hplc ? if it
really needs to be under ena , we will need to un - do the 10 / 1 / 99 assignment to
hplc or set - up a new contract between ena & praxair .
please advise .

cheryl ,
the counterparties with which ena currently sales gas are :
city of brazoria
central illinois light company
d & h gas company , inc .
markham gas
merit energy partners
praxair
reliant energy - entex
reliant energy - hl & p
southern union company
texas utilities fuel company ( now txu fuel co )
union carbide corporation
unit gas transmission company inc
ena has transacted with the other companies listed below , but that will most
likely not happen again . ( hpl will trade with those counterparties . )
all ena trades on hpl will be in sitara . we have reports which can be
generated out of cpr that can list all deals by counterparty for ena . let me
know if you need something like that .
let me know if you have any other questions .

subject : ena sales on hpl
i am working on a project for brenda herod & was wondering if one of you
could tell me if i ' m on the right track & if this will get everything for
which she is looking .
she is trying to draft a long - term transport / storage agreement between ena &
hplc which will allow ena to move the gas to their markets . in order to
accomplish this , she needs to know all of the sales to customers that ena is
doing off of hpl ' s pipe .
i had scott mills run a report from sitara showing all ena buy / sell activity
on hpl since 7 / 99 . if i eliminate the buys & the desk - to - desk deals , will
this give me everything that i need ?
are there buy / sell deals done with ena on hpl ' s pipe that wouldn ' t show up in
sitara ? someone mentioned something about deals where hpl transports the gas
on it ' s own behalf then ena sells it to a customer at that same spot - -
? ? ? ? ? do deals like that happen ? would they show up in sitara ?
is there anything else that i ' m missing ? i ' m not real familiar with how some
of these deals happen nowadays so am very receptive to any
ideas / suggestions / help that you can offer ! ! !
thanks in advance .Subject: 24 x 5 products

subject : 24 x 5 products
eric bass , texas desk trader , requested the following product described below
be traded on enrononline . this product will not bridge into sitara and will
have to be put in manually .
the reason it will not bridge is due to the fact that it can have multiple
stripes of start & end dates rather than one start & end date . currently ,
enrononline can
only send one start & end date per deal therefore it will fail in the bridge
monitor and will have to be manually entered into sitara & subsequently
cleared out of the monitor .
since these transactions could flow next day , it is imperative that these
transactions get into sitara as soon as possible . please read the full
description below . ( this product looks like a month long deal but excludes
weekends . the " wkd " is short for week days . )
we do not anticipate a large volume of these transactions but need to be
prepared to react quickly when they do . for the future , we are looking into
the cost / benefit of enrononline having the capability of sending multiple
dates for these types of products .
if you have any questions , please call me at 3 - 5824

days 8 and 11 have small discrepancies . i got with carlos on the 5 / 19
discrepancy . he checked the numbers sent to him by tufco . he verified that
it should be 8 . 333 . i also checked with steve in gas control regarding what
flowed for tufco . steve told me 8 . 300 . i have gone back into mops and
corrected these volumes . this should impact the ua 4 number . also , this
decreases the midtexas cumulative imbalance . as of 5 / 23 pg & e owes hpl
4 . 649 . if you have any questions , please let me know .

get to a satisfactory level of data quality . this process can start with
this months data collection efforts . please pay particular attention this
month as the " bar is being raised " by the management of energy operations for
data quality and timeliness .

foleys . she was honest with me that she did not necessarily want to do
allocations again and that she really enjoyed working with the schedulers and
traders , although she doesn ' t necessarily want to schedule or trade . she
mentioned risk specifically . i think she would be an asset to enron . please

good afternoon everyone ,
i would like to present megan jones for consideration of the sr . specialist
position ( job 103143 )
as for your essential requirements , she meets and exceeds them all .
accounting degree from ut , very detailed , knowledge of the gas industry ,
excellent communication skills , and over 2 years of experience .
regarding essential functions , she could perform them right away . her
resume shows detail of experience .
megan left coral energy to get into a department at sonat which would
provide her more of a challenge . she was truly being utilized as a
" bean - counter " and wanted more interaction with others . she went to work at
sonat which she says is the best job she ever had . she enjoyed the company ,
people , everything . . . as you know , sonat was bought by el paso which ended
her position along with others in her department .
she honestly took her current position in haste , but also thought it would
give her the experience of using her accounting skills , but having more
interaction with others in an audit capacity . this has not been the case .
she misses the industry , and learns quickly , very social and has no problem
interacting with people at all levels .
let me know your thoughts and any questions you may have .
best regards ,
sharon

our gas supply contract with lubrizol expired effective may 1 , 2000 and
lubrizol began purchasing from tejas . lubrizol has decided not to execute a
keep - ready agreement with hpl to keep this meter on stand - by . therefore ,
please take the necessary steps to classify this meter as ' inactive ' and
insure that no future volumes flow through this meter .
charlie - we will leave this station in place for now and try to recapture
this market in three years . please have this station locked and secured as
soon as possible to prevent lubrizol from taking any unauthorized volumes
should tejas be unable to deliver gas for any reason .

please put the ena 201 contract at this meter for april and may of 1999 with
the track id 117848 and reallocate the meter for both months . after this is
done please let stephanie and i know so that she can redraft her invoice the
next day after pops bridges to mops . also with respect to the second issue
where daren is asking for the price , stephanie may be able to help you with
this because she has a copy of duke ' s invoice .

the crow o ' conner meter is essentially fixed . when aimee reallocates you
will have to wait until the next day to redraft your invoice . when aimee
gets back with us please redraft the invoice the next day and let me know if

the new sitara to unify bridge monitor is in production .
the monitor shows deals in error state ( failed ) or in queue to bridge
( pending ) - for deals going to unify from sitara .
you will find it under - start - programs - trading - sitara - su bridge
monitor .
you may need to load the borland bde v 5 . 0 software to use this , if not
already loaded .
we enhanced the monitor to make it a more useful tool .
if deal is in an error state on the sitara side - we have not sent it over to
unify .
if the deal in an error state on the unify side - sitara has sent it to unify
- however - it is in the unify failed deal group .
you can sort by the columns - best to sort by business unit .
the date column - shows the last time someone edited the deal .
start date and stop date - are begin and end date of deal .
sitara deal id - as well as - eol deal id .
indicates if the deal is an business unit is an agent on the deal .
if you are contract or validation support - please do not edit the status = p
deals - these are the deals with pending status for desk to desk transactions
( awaiting the other desk to approve the deal or changes to the deal ) . if you
release these deals - you will be the approver of the deal - as you have
access to multiple desks .
you can hit the refresh button to re - query the data - or set the auto refresh
on the tool bar .
we did not build filter by business unit for multiple reasons :
- the expense to build the filter .
- it is easier to support if everyone is looking at the same thing .
- if there is a new business unit - you will see it .
- normally - there should not be more than a screen full of deals in error
state - once petro can / suncor / sunoco are set up - we will have a reasonable
number to look at - and you can sort by the business unit column .
- if you do want to filter - you may do so - by using the send to excel
feature - under tool bar option - file - dump to excel .
if you have any questions or problems - please call the sitara hotline .Subject: wc 551 revision effective 6 / 6 / 00 ( stingray p / l )

daren :
thanks again for your prompt attention to this matter , i appreciate it .
there is a slight problem however , i couldn ' t find the deals for july and
november 1999 in path manager . i looked in sitara and i see where you put
the deal 269123 in for may 1999 , but it is also in for july and november of
2000 . did you mean to put the deal in for july and november of 1999 and
inadvertently put it in for july and november 2000 ? if so would you put it
in for july and november 1999 and send me an e - mail when you are done .
thanks ,

please put the ena 201 contract at this meter for april and may of 1999 with
the track id 117848 and reallocate the meter for both months . after this is
done please let stephanie and i know so that she can redraft her invoice the
next day after pops bridges to mops . also with respect to the second issue
where daren is asking for the price , stephanie may be able to help you with
this because she has a copy of duke ' s invoice .
stephanie :
the crow o ' conner meter is essentially fixed . when aimee reallocates you
will have to wait until the next day to redraft your invoice . when aimee
gets back with us please redraft the invoice the next day and let me know if
this issue is resolved .

i am sending the survey out this time as an opportunity to introduce myself
to those of you i have not yet met . i am being asked to take a direct roll
in the further development and rollout of the operations pricing model ( fka
transaction cost model ) . in the past , i have directed the implementation of
several pricing systems based on activity based costing similar to the
operations pricing model ( opm ) . over the past couple of weeks my
observations of the model have lead me to be concerned with the quality of
data used in the model . it will take efforts by both you and the opm team to
get to a satisfactory level of data quality . this process can start with
this months data collection efforts . please pay particular attention this
month as the " bar is being raised " by the management of energy operations for
data quality and timeliness .
while completing the survey , take this time to review last month ' s numbers .
please return these surveys to shari mao by end of day friday , june 2 .
please note the following changes :
the nat gas rc ' s will now see deal validation and transportation rate
activities therefore , these surveys will be notably longer but will not
necessarily take more time
if the survey does not contain an activity that your team spends time on ,
please do not type any activities in the survey . contact jennifer reside at
# 35971 to discuss how to proceed .
if you have any questions relating to the model or this survey , or are unable
to meet the survey due date , please call jennifer reside at # 35971 ( shari is
on vacation this week ) .Subject: eis invoices for may
i just wanted to make all of you aware of the message below from financial
operations . when you review your rc reports for may , you will not see any it

see some large charges in june for 3 months ( april - june ) . if you have any
questions , please call me . thanks .

fyi ,
transco has called wanting to know who is responsible for nominating devon ' s
pvr . we do not have access to their contracts to do
the noms . ces use to have transco do it for them and so did we for january
and february , but nothing was nominated for march or april . i
mentioned this to nelson and dan junek back in march , but nothing was
decided . at one time , devon did not want to give us access to nominate
their pvr because they did not want us to have access to any of their
information . could you find out if we are responsible for the pvr and if we
are , they
have to make us agent to nominate on those particular contracts ? maybe you
will have better luck than i did .

sorry for the delay . . . ami
1 . tom asked for a historical number for entex the 2 nd week on the job in the
morning meeting . he wasn  , t expecting me to bring forth anything because i had
just started . no one provided any information after the first day , so i
decided to look it up and do it myself . tom was very pleased .
2 . tom gave that info to ed , and he asked for further data :
a . about cinco ranch , greatwood , and spring interconnects
i coordinated with brad blevins and applied it to the fact that origination
was booked for nov , but the points had yet to be operational . brad and i
remain in close contact to share any entex interconnect info .
b . research transport info
documented why entex transport volumes decreased by 6000 , and used info
towards the audit
c . check weather forecast for nov
i got weather info from mike roberts and developed some volumes that
corresponded with historical data related to the average of the forecast . tom  ,
s response was , " this is great . why hasn  , t anyone been able to do this
before . "
3 . prepare and present entex info in morning meetings and prebid meetings .
4 . work with weather research group to get better understanding of entex
trends .
5 . prepare information gathering entex data including :
midcon vols
price behavior
temperature and weather conditions
hpl vols
6 . thoroughly understand and apply entex contracts :
- realize need for daily vols and mentor summer intern to put together data
base of historical information ( winter cap )
- recognized accounting discrepancy that saved us $ 11 , 000
- reorganized entex tracking spreadsheets to incorporate a variety of info ,
including booked volumes , weather , and contract terms
- part of the audit team
7 . managed weather hedge ( swap and put )
after doing some background work , i found out that the weather research group
was incorrect , and their files were feeding incorrect data ( iah temps instead
of hou temps ) . this find resulted in a gain on of $ 3 , 376 , 780 .
8 . handle ces deals on the texas desk
- organized and facilitated a meeting with back office to review all ces deals
- incorporated all ces info with enron systems
- fully gather all data
- liaison between devon and enron ( whole trade floor )
- ensure all information was correct
- praised by :
joan quick - " you went above and beyond the call of duty "
howard camp - " when i met with the other regions , texas was the only one that
had its the info in line and organized "
9 . develop good relationship with entex
10 . facilitate monthly meeting with cross - functional entex team to resolve
issues , discuss current happenings , and to keep everyone in the " know "
11 . tufco

stacey neuweilerSubject: re : prc meeting agenda recap
to clarify the discussion below : i will not be discussing the promotion
candidates with sally prior to her prc meeting on 6 / 19 / 00 .
as a reminder , our prc meeting will be held on tuesday , 6 / 13 in eb 37 cl ,
beginning @ 12 : 00 noon . lunch will be served , and yvette has drinks and
snacks throughout the day . our goal will be not to have dinner , but if
necessary , we will . i suggest each of you to make arrangements to stay as
late as needed to ensure we reach a quality work product .
our agenda :
review of ground rules and responsibilities of the committee .
each of you will provide a general business assessment of your team . hr
challenges should be identified along with needed skill sets , gap analysis
and succession planning . the template below should be used for the format .
i am not interested in discussing the business goals , but you probably need
to think through these in order to discuss the assessments that we will want
to discuss as a group .
review and discussion of exempt employees . each will be categorized into the
six descriptors used in the feedback process . i am expecting each of you to
have a listing of accomplishments from your employees along with factual
feedback and observations which will allow you to place your employees into
appropriate categories . i would like to stress that the data to sustantiate
the performance descriptor should be factual and documented . the focus of
employee discussions must be on each employee ' s individual contribution
towards accomplishing our business goals . we must safeguard our discussions
from " he said , she said " periferal distractors , and focus on the work product .
promotion candidates discussion .
once again , the prc process is a valued process at enron . each of you have
been through it , so you understand the importance of confidentiality .
additionally , the committee will be required to reach an unanimous vote .
please come to the meeting with your " enron " hat on - not your individual
group hat . our people are critical to our business . therefore , it is
important for us to be honest when evaluating our staff . we must identify
our stengths and weaknesses , and work towards strengthening our people to
ensure the very best business service we can provide . what this means is
that we should provide our employees with the very best constructive feedback
possible . in some cases , you may be providing a tough message , but it is our
responsibility and obligation to ensure that each employee fully understands
expectations , where they are on point and where they are not on point of
meeting these expectations so that they can have the next six months to build
needed skill sets and / or correct behaviors . this is your obligation as their
immediate supervisor . if you have any questions , concerns or issues you
would like to talk about prior to the meeting on tuesday , please contact me
or hector .
in advance , i appreciate your time , energy and professionalism in this
process .

the volume associated with the sales ( seller ) side to the sitara deal .
currently , the volume on the receipt ( buyer ) side is being posted . this
change will be implemented in order to coincide with the logic currently

with sap now here there are going to be a few minor changes that we will all
have to make immediately .
first :
everyone will have to make internet explorer their default browser . if
you ' re not sure how to do this give me a call and i will help . the reason
for this is that our new timesheet program will only run through internet
explorer .
second :
sometime next week we will have a brown bag lunch where i will walk you
through entering your time in this new system . it ' s not time consuming just
different .
third :
next thursday you will be e - mailed an sap log - on id and password . please
don ' t delete or disregard the importance of this e - mail . you will need it to
key your time .
fourth :
all company and rc # ' s are changing . the company part is easy . it will be 4
digits so if your company number is currently 413 it will now be 0413 or if
it is 012 it will now be 0012 . easy . rc # ' s are now called cost centers and
they are changing completely . please write these down somewhere you will
need them just like you need to know your rc .
rc 1497 = cc 105633
rc 1638 = cc 105634

rc 2940 = cc 106290
rc 2663 = cc 105629
the transition shouldn ' t be too painful for you but it promises to be a
little stressful for your assistants so please bear with us and cooperate .

subject : unify stress test next week with sybase 12 . 0
we have done some preliminary testing of the latest version of sybase
( version 12 ) . we have seen very positive results from our initial tests and
would like to proceed with a " stress test " ( not to be confused with me
showing up each day at work ) . we would like to do 2 tests next week due to
hardware and business restrictions .
the test would be similar to those from late - 1998 ( ah , those were the
days ! ) . we will ask all users , as well as i . t . folks , to run as many of
their usual processing during a scripted time frame from approx noon - 1 : 30 pm
on tuesday and wednesday . be sure to order some yummy pizza or sandwiches for
your staff !
the sybase 12 . 0 environment can be accessed via start / programs / test
applications / unify applications / unify gas - power stage . on the login window ,
select server = " ase 12 test " . if you usual production password does not
work , try " houston " . if that does not work , try a neighbor ' s ( audit says
that fine , its just a test ) . each user should plan to run several sessions
where permissible to simulate a heavy load on the system and to make up for
those not able to participate during this time . please have your staff try
to login some time monday to insure they have access .
the test script during the time period will be :
12 : 00 - 1 : 30 logistics : pathing , nominating , running some reports
12 : 20 - 1 : 30 volume management : do your thing
12 : 40 - 1 : 30 settlements / accounting : pile in
please let me know if your area would not be able to assist in this very
important test . the results of these 2 tests will dictate whether we should
pursue our migration to this new release in mid - july . the less bid weeks
with poor system performance the better !

today enron and hades announced a definitive energy services agreement said
to be worth an estimated $ 666 trillion .
in the deal , enron will provide both gas and electric commodities to hades '
facilities throughout and under north america . john d . rockefeller , former
ceo of energy monopolist standard oil , is now head of hades ' energy
management division . said rockefeller , " obviously hell has significant
heating demands . while eternal flames are a great idea in concept , they
require vast and reliable fuel resources . enron was the only supplier
willing to make a deal with my boss , and , as a former monopolist , i just
like the way they do business . "
a spokesperson for enron said the two cultures were able to work easily
together during negotiations . according to the company , " the deal fits both
companies exceptionally well . with hades ' ability to attract and retain new
customers , we see this as a fabulous growth opportunity for millennia to
come . " according to several energy industry insiders , hades ' high heating
demand with very little need for summer air conditioning make it a very
attractive energy portfolio addition .
hades is a multinational corporation with millions of sites worldwide and
approximately 173 quintillion customers . the entity boasts sustained high
growth rates over the last two thousand years .
enron is one of the world ' s leading energy and communications companies .
the company owns approximately $ 37 billion in energy and communications
assets . enron ranks in the top quarter of fortune ' s " best 100 companies to
work for if you can keep a job there and don ' t mind working 80 hours a
week , " and is among the most respected corporations in america , as ranked by
customers with respect - us - or - get - curtailed clauses in their energy supply

application of the fuel retained from transportation and treating contracts
doesn ' t have to be done by zone or compressor , in fact i am sure there will
be times when we are either short or long compressor fuel when compared to
the pipelines total usage . usually , short . i just do not think the market
will let me lay off all of this risk . it would be really nice if we could
get the system to track compressor fuel used to service specific contracts
but i am afraid it will always be a facility planning issue . fuel should not
cause imbalances on the transportation contract . a pipeline could be long
fuel due to not running compression and in that case we would have to inject
or hold in linepack the excess . it seems that we would look at fuel on a
total basis .

julie ,
in 1996 , a contract was drawn up between hplr and teco gas processing ,
contract numbers 078 - 86978 - 101 / 078 - 86978 - 301 . in april ' 99 , these contracts
were assigned to ect . in october of 1998 , these contracts should have been
assigned to hplc , but did not get assigned . beginning in jan . ' 99 , negative
volumes started appearing in my purchase payment statements under sitara
# 18372 ( meter # 6884 ) , causing my payments to be reduced . i believe that the
deal number for the sale was being attached to the purchase contract . ( the
purchase deal numbers which i have been using are sitara # 14086 and sitara
# 11079 ) . both these sales and purchases ( since october ' 98 ) are suppose to
be for hplc . donald reinhart stated that spot purchase and spot sale gtc ' s
between teco and hplc can be set up from october of 1998 until the master
contract is changed . amelia alland has set these up , which i believe
terminate in october ' 99 . the gtc spot contract numbers are as follows :
purchases : 012 - 86978 - 102 ; global 96021450
sales : 012 - 86978 - 301 ; global 96021451

when complete , can you tell me what the new deal numbers will be ?

bh ,
i plan to be on vacation july 5 - 6 ( finally ) and on the customer trip on the
7 th . while i am out , gary hanks will be keeping our position during
trading . stacey will be in charge of everything else . i am comfortable that
everything will be covered .
i will be back in town thursday night . the primary flight for the customer
trip leaves around 11 : 30 . others leave at 3 : 30 and 5 : 30 ( ? ) . the latest
idea we had is that pat would take a later flight on this trip and i will
take a later flight on the august trip , allowing one of us to be in the
office for half the day . i can also come in for the half day on the 7 th if
we decide that is needed .

hi ,
?
how is the family ? ? ? ? and the multiple jobs ? ? ? ? ? ?
?
we just got back from omaha - - - linda ' s 40 th high school reunion . i wish
someone would explain to me who all those old people were that attended .
?
putting $ 1 . 85 a gallon gas in that beast of hers was sure fun . i may need a
part - time job if this keeps up long . ( just kidding - - you probably have
enough to deal with - - right )
?
jennifer has decided to journey off to law school at baylor . she and linda
are going to waco friday to finalize an apartment .
chris is managing the i - 10 texas land & cattle store . keeps him very busy .
( can ' t even send an e - mail - - - - - like someone else i know ) ( just kidding )
?
we are looking for property on a lake ( linda ' s request ) . like there is
anything like that left in texas . we will probably drop in this house .
?
pretty quiet here all things considered .
?
drop me a line or give me a call when you have some time . or if you are
really free we could actually plan a lunch . the price of natural gas should
help keep tom from hassling you too much .

wanted to give you a heads up to these flexible physical deals that might
involve your desks via eol in the near future . we already have one in the
east . i stressed to the sitara / eol folks the importance of adding comments
to the term sections of these baseload and term tickets so we know what is
happening . one side of these buy / sell or exchange deals will be ratable and
the corresponding partner ticket will have the optionality . comments will
include the corresponding deal number , that it is in fact a buy / sell or
exchange deal and the delivery time period ( 3 , 5 or 10 days ) that the
counterparty desires .
i hope this helps . . . thanks !

got any ideas on how this transaction should look . this looks like a monthly
volume that would be further refined to daily on the expected volumes once
the counterparty has made their decision ( i would imagine logistics will be
the one communicating with the counterparty ) . we probably need eol to
indicate whether it is a 3 , 5 , 10 day delivery cycle and then indicate this
as comments .
linda / karen - what are your thoughts on how separate gtc would work on this .
if we could all do a little homework . i will get something scheduled for
next week to discuss further .

subject : flexible physical us nat gas products on enrononline
we are positioning ourselves to release a new product type that we will refer
to as a flexible physical gas product . legal is in the process of drafting a
gtc and product type description that will be used with this product type . i
will start the building process once legal provides the gtc and product type
description ; but in the interim , here ' s a broadstroke description of how the
transaction works :
party a and party b exchange gas during the month of june 2000 .
party a buys 10 , 000 mmbtu per day ( or 300 , 000 total mmbtu ) at tco pool index
party b has the right to notify party a of when party b wants to take
delivery during the month of june , and may take delivery in one of three
forms : 3 - day delivery , 5 - day delivery , or 10 - day delivery . the gas nominated
for each such day would be a percentage of the total 300 , 000 mmbtu ( i . e . ; if
party b chooses 5 days for nomination , party a would deliver 20 % of the
300 , 000 mmbtu on each of those 5 days for a total nom of 100 % ) . party b pay
tco pool index plus a premium .
i understand that this type of transaction is currently done
over - the - counter . scott mills has previously issued an explanatory e - mail of
sitara concerns and we should begin to address those issues .
bjorn - if you could ask someone to prepare a sigma factor in advance , then
my turn around time to for the product type should be reduced . also , due to
the varying ' optionality ' , do you think these three different products will
require three different product types ?
please feel free to call if you have any questions .

it is amazing and yet not surprising how much enron has accomplished in the
first six months of this year . you continue to make it happen . we recognize
that you work hard every day to accomplish enron  , s business goals , and we are
pleased that many of you have shared in the company  , s financial success
through enron stock options .
as you may know , the current employee stock option program ( also known as the
all employee stock option program or aesop ) began in 1994 and provided value
to participants through 2000 . employees who have participated in this
program from its inception have realized a 1 , 119 % increase in the value of
their stock options ( assuming a stock price of $ 70 ) over the life of the
program .
enron stock options are a valuable part of your total compensation package
and a contributing factor to your performance and to enron  , s continued
success . therefore , the enron executive committee and the compensation and
management development committee of the enron board of directors have decided
to continue to offer stock options as a part of your compensation package .
on may 1 , 2000 , the committee approved an employee stock option program for
calendar years 2001 - 2005 ( enronoptions  ) your stock option program ) . it is
expected that enronoptions  ) your stock option program will be granted ,
effective on or about december 29 , 2000 , for those employees who are eligible
on that date ( please see note below ) . the new program , which is subject to
final approval by enron  , s board of directors , is as follows :
? enronoptions  ) your stock option program will give stock options to
eligible full - time and part - time regular employees in domestic and
international companies / locations .
? the grant of non - qualified stock options will equal 25 % of annual base
salary ( 5 % of annual base salary for each year of a 5 - year period ) on
december 29 , 2000 . ( salary calculation and value may vary in some
international locations . )
? the board will grant the stock options on december 29 , 2000 .
? eligible employees hired in subsequent years will receive a prorated grant
of stock options .
why commit your talent and energy to enron ? enronoptions  ) your stock option
program , among other good reasons  ( that  , s why .
in the coming weeks , you will be receiving more details about enronoptions  )
your stock option program . to provide information and answer your questions ,
we will introduce a special link on the human resources web - site , host
several espeak sessions and continue to communicate with you on a regular
basis . in the meantime , if you have immediate questions , please contact your
human resources representative .
note : in addition to final approval by enron  , s board of directors , granting
of options will be subject to new york stock exchange and state and federal
regulatory requirements . it is expected that enronoptions  ) your stock
option program will be available to most enron employees ; however , some enron
companies  , employees may not be eligible due to legal , accounting , tax , labor
or business issues . as you know , enron changes to meet the needs of the
marketplaces we serve . given that need to change , we will continue to refine
the eligibility for enronoptions  ) your stock option program and will
communicate more details throughout the year with final eligibility being
determined on december 29 , 2000 .Subject: re : industrials

when will the buybacks and swings be set up for july ? i am a little
concerned with the long weekend coming up . i believe that we agreed that
these would be set up by the 3 rd work day , which would be friday the 7 th .
( six days of flow . ) i definitely don ' t think that we should any later . it
would be great if this could be handled sooner , miimizing our economic impact .
additionally , we need to get the industrial spreadsheet up and running
again . this report is very beneficial to gas control , industrial traders and
schedulers on call .
let me know what you think .
dSubject: july transport usage tickets
i have input and updated transport usage tickets for july . i did not update
one for the demand charge for pgev / maypearl delivery , so if there is one , you
will have to set it up in the system . if you have any questions , please let
me know . also , pay close attention to the oasis and pg & e tickets for this
month . i do not yet know what baseload rates you have agreed upon , so you
will need to adjust them in the appropriate tickets . if you would , please
let me know , too , what baseload business and rates you have agreed upon for
both these pipelines . thank you .

in regards to meter 098 - 4179 the following information is what i have been
able to determine from the information available to me .
to your questions :
1 . cannot determine who owns this meter . i will contact molly carriere on
monday when she returns .
2 . hpl has a fifty ( 50 ) ft . easement at this location which does contain
language for appurtenance rights within the 50 ' .
3 . i pulled the meter file for this location which was prepared during
project rock and it does not contain a facility agreement so i am assuming
one was not located .
hope this helps .

shawna ,
attached is a contract preparation request for a facilities agreement for the
coastal oil the
legal department has prepared and is currently circulating a ratification and

we have been unable to locate an existing facility agreement for the 3

the facility agreement requested herein is intended to cover only alterations
to be made to existing meter 098 - 4179 to install an h 2 s monitor and necessary
valving to allow hplc to accept gas from the newly drilled albrecht # 4 well .
once the h 2 s monitor has been installed and the albrecht # 4 well is ready to
flow , we intend to paper the purchase of gas from the albrecht # 4 well only
via a spot confirmation pursuant to a spot gtc . the albrecht # 4 will not be
covered by 96008903 , nor will the wells currently subject to 96008903 be
subject to the spot gtc .
coastal will reimburse hplc $ 39 , 600 for the cost of the installation .

we intend to attempt to connect about 4 , 000 mmbtu / d of new production from
the newly drilled coastal oil in may , 2000 , the meter flowed about 960
mmbtu / d of 3 . 36 % co 2 gas .
the content of the albrecht # 4 gas according to the field gas analysis
prepared by coastal oil the albrecht # 4 h 2 s content
is similar to that of the three wells currently producing 960 mmbtu / d behind
meter 098 - 4179 , the miller - albrecht unit # 1 - a and the hoff heller gas unit
# 1 a & # 2 d . coastal further purports that for some time now it ( and / or its
predecessor , mjg , corp . ) has treated these three wells for h 2 s in a manner
sufficient to reduce the h 2 s content delivered into hplc to permissible
levels . coastal has further indicated that it intends to reduce the h 2 s
content of the albrecht # 4 to permissible levels before delivering same to
hplc . in your opinion , should coastal be forced to install an h 2 s monitor
for this new gas prior to flowing same to hplc ?

subject : update on prc process
today was the final ena prc . relative ranking results up through the senior
director level are final . you and your management team can begin the process
of giving performance reviews to your employees . i spoke with sheila walton
today to inquire about an expected time frame for completing and conducting
the employee reviews . she indicated that the target completion date should
be the end of july .
promotions will be effective august lst . it is dave delainey ' s intent to
announce ena promotions sometime after he returns from vacation on july 24 .
this drives the end of july target completion date for reviews . i do not
yet know if delainey wants all ena promotions to be announced in a single
memo , or if each group within ena will prepare such a memo . i will keep you
updated on this as i get direction from him .
please note the following change since our energy operations prc in june . in
order to place focus on the qualitative feedback during this mid - year review
process , we will not share performance clusters with employees when
conducting their reviews . it is very important for all of us to be
consistent in this process , so please communicate this to all in your groups
who will be giving performance reviews . it is important to note , however ,
that the content of an employee ' s review should be consistent with our view
of that employee ' s relative ranking . in other words , an employee in the
satisfactory category should not be given a review that simply states that
the employee is doing a great job . clearly , a large number of employees
performed at a higher level than those employees in the satisfactory
category , so the feedback to that employee should include some specific areas
of improvement needed in order for the employee to make a stronger impact in
the organization , help you achieve the groups goals , etc .
also please note the following :
performance reviews for anyone in the satisfactory , needs improvement or
issues categories must be reviewed by hr prior to these reviews being given
to the employees . this will ensure that our feedback is commensurate with
the relative performance of that employee . ( this has been the stated process
for the bottom two categories , and we are adding satisfactory to this process
as well . )
please remember to include a more experienced member of your management team ,
yourself , or an hr professional in reviews being conducted by inexperienced
members of your management team , or those management team members where you
have a concern over their ability or willingness to deliver candid and
perhaps tough performance feedback . i believe that we have spent some time
in identifying these situations . i ask your help to ensure that we follow
through on this commitment .
thanks for all of your efforts in making this mid - year prc process a
meaningful one .

in regards to meter 098 - 4179 the following information is what i have been
able to determine from the information available to me .
to your questions :
1 . cannot determine who owns this meter . i will contact molly carriere on
monday when she returns .
2 . hpl has a fifty ( 50 ) ft . easement at this location which does contain
language for appurtenance rights within the 50 ' .
3 . i pulled the meter file for this location which was prepared during
project rock and it does not contain a facility agreement so i am assuming
one was not located .
hope this helps .

attached is a contract preparation request for a facilities agreement for the

we have been unable to locate an existing facility agreement for the 3

the facility agreement requested herein is intended to cover only alterations
to be made to existing meter 098 - 4179 to install an h 2 s monitor and necessary
valving to allow hplc to accept gas from the newly drilled albrecht # 4 well .
once the h 2 s monitor has been installed and the albrecht # 4 well is ready to

covered by 96008903 , nor will the wells currently subject to 96008903 be

we intend to attempt to connect about 4 , 000 mmbtu / d of new production from
the newly drilled coastal oil in may , 2000 , the meter flowed about 960
mmbtu / d of 3 . 36 % co 2 gas .
the content of the albrecht # 4 gas according to the field gas analysis
prepared by coastal oil the albrecht # 4 h 2 s content
is similar to that of the three wells currently producing 960 mmbtu / d behind
meter 098 - 4179 , the miller - albrecht unit # 1 - a and the hoff heller gas unit
# 1 a & # 2 d . coastal further purports that for some time now it ( and / or its
predecessor , mjg , corp . ) has treated these three wells for h 2 s in a manner
sufficient to reduce the h 2 s content delivered into hplc to permissible
levels . coastal has further indicated that it intends to reduce the h 2 s
content of the albrecht # 4 to permissible levels before delivering same to
hplc . in your opinion , should coastal be forced to install an h 2 s monitor
for this new gas prior to flowing same to hplc ?

transaction execution skills that are necessary to execute complex ,
structured transactions and to foster better deal quality . we believe that
the primary objectives of the ctg have been achieved , and in order to better
position the organization for the remainder of 2000 and in response to ray
bowen  , s new position , the following changes will be made in the commercial
transactions group organization .

characteristics , ( b ) are evaluated in the context of market based pricing
signals , and ( c ) incorporate a specific investment plan which includes
syndication of the investment , if applicable , and a specific exit strategy .
portfolio management includes restructuring / special assets ( randy
maffett / dick lydecker ) and capital structuring ( andrea reed ) . steve pruett
( energy capital resources ) , chuck ward ( generation investments ) , don miller
( merchant generation ) , and chris helfrich ( coal and industrial ) will continue

we are going to add a new drop down flag to storage in sitara to
differentiate the difference between physical and synthetic storage - as each
are
treated differently for inventory accounting purposes . a change will also
be made to global contracts and unify , and is intended to assist with oa
variances
on storage .
on the next release ( mid august ) we will add a drop down on the storage deal
type which will be a required field .
someone will need to edit the existing deals to add the flag - as it will be
a required field - physical facility or synthetic .
( we can create queries to work with you on identifying deals that need to be
converted - as well as results for global conversion )
global contracts uses the flags from sitara to set up new contracts - so
sitara will add the flag on the deal .
the flag will be stored in global contracts - which will feed the flag to
unify .
once the existing deals are converted in sitara , global contracts can add the
appropriate flag to their system .
once this is complete and unify is ready , unify can begin to feed in the
information from global contracts , and we will then
be able to differentiate the two in the accounting system .
in the interim time , you may want to identify your synthetic vs . physical
storage deals .

here is a high level summary of our discussions last week . i believe that
the calculations listed below under option 1 show how hpl would like to
capture deals and see their postions all based on a 24 hour flow rate basis .
option 2 shows what the values would look like under an hourly flow basis .
bob : please review with the other trading directors and see if they also
prefer to see everything on a 24 hour flow rate basis . thanks ! - tommySubject: pictures

please keep me in the loop as these contacts are made and let me know how i
can help .Subject: parking
for prior periods - i am not sure if you need to handle this using the
instructions below - or if for prior months only - if you would be allowed
to create a
cashout ticket to clear out any prior period imbalances . your controller
and volume management ( kathy kelly ) should make this call .
kim and david can brain check me on this - but i think this is how parking
should be done ; however ,
please verify with west or east desk economics to ensure accuracy / consistency .
parking procedures
create a storage deal in sitara - service type : parking
use this service deal to path to a storage account in unify - this way you
have accounted for the gas in unify
inject into storage account
withdrawal from storage account
( when you do the opposite of parking - withdrawal first - it is called a
" loan " )
create two economic deals in sitara - exchange deal
create an internal buy and sell of physical gas for economics and position
purposes - ( no invoices - fake 3 rd party )
exchange deal -
sell to cpr pipeline exchange ( parking gas )
buy from cpr pipeline exchange ( getting gas back )
within the month parking - no money exchanges hands - except any service fees
which can be recorded on the storage deal .
sell to cpr pipeline exchange ( parking gas ) - price = $ 0
buy from cpr pipeline exchange ( getting gas back ) price = $ 0
when the deal crosses a month - if you keep the risk within the desk - in the
short term you record a big loss - sell at $ 0 - and the
next month you record a big gain - buy at $ 0 . to manage this - usually the
cash desk swaps out the time risk to a storage financial book - who will pick
up the time
spread loss and offsetting gain - as this book captures forward value .
when you are adjusting your physical injections ( parking ) within the month -
you will need to
adjust your swaps too - which will adjust the p & l for the time spread
accordingly - otherwise you will have liquidation problems .
period 1 - sell to cpr pipeline exchange ( parking gas ) - price = $ 0 swap
to firm book for index + mid
period 2 - buy from cpr pipeline exchange ( getting gas back ) price = $ 0
swap to firm book for index + midSubject: fun pics . htm

team ,
as i mentioned in our hpl staff meeting we are investigating the merits of
entering into a joint venture or another transaction structure that will
position hpl to effectively compete in the texas intrastate market . our
primary objective is to gain access to additional sources of gas supply and
achieve the required economies of scale to compete with other intrastate
pipelines . i would appreciate your confidence and support in developing the
optimal course of action for hpl and for enron .
the skills that we have developed in our group are critical to growing our
upstream origination business in n . america , as well as to the ongoing
operation of hpl . our origination strategy is to leverage our business
operations , field operations , engineering , producer services , and marketing
skills to capture value from transportation , gathering , storage and commodity
opportunities on the gas / power grids . we need our current employees to
accomplish this objective across n . america .
we have proven our ability to add value to enron by developing the
powder / wind river pipelines , installing electric compressors , contracting for
processing capacity , and establishing a new gas supply corridor along the
gulf coast . our recent efforts to provide services such as business
operations , measurement , trading / marketing , and accounting services to third
party producers and pipelines also looks to be a promising growth opportunity .
it is very important to our ongoing business relationships and our
competitive position in the market place that we do not discuss hpl related
matters with third parties . please come see me if you have any specific
questions or concerns . also please refer any third party inquiries regarding
hpl to tim determing .

subject : hpl optimization
team ,
as i mentioned in our hpl staff meeting we are investigating the merits of
entering into a joint venture or another transaction structure that will
position hpl to effectively compete in the texas intrastate market . our
primary objective is to gain access to additional sources of gas supply and
achieve the required economies of scale to compete with other intrastate
pipelines . i would appreciate your confidence and support in developing the
optimal course of action for hpl and for enron .
the skills that we have developed in our group are critical to growing our
upstream origination business in n . america , as well as to the ongoing
operation of hpl . our origination strategy is to leverage our business
operations , field operations , engineering , producer services , and marketing
skills to capture value from transportation , gathering , storage and commodity
opportunities on the gas / power grids . we need our current employees to
accomplish this objective across n . america .
we have proven our ability to add value to enron by developing the
powder / wind river pipelines , installing electric compressors , contracting for
processing capacity , and establishing a new gas supply corridor along the
gulf coast . our recent efforts to provide services such as business
operations , measurement , trading / marketing , and accounting services to third
party producers and pipelines also looks to be a promising growth opportunity .
it is very important to our ongoing business relationships and our
competitive position in the market place that we do not discuss hpl related
matters with third parties . please come see me if you have any specific
questions or concerns . also please refer any third party inquiries regarding
hpl to tim determing .
regards ,
brianSubject: new version of stack manager
introduction
in response to feedback received from enron traders worldwide , we have
upgraded and improved the stack manager to include new functionality which we
hope will improve its effectiveness and usefulness in the management of your
products .
this new release will be automatically installed within the next few days .
please ensure you log out at night in order to receive the upgrade .
summary of new features
multiple children - a " child " product can be the " parent " of another child
( multiple links in a chain ) and different types of links can be placed
against a single parent .
static product bar prices - when you change a price in the product bar and
hit the " + " or " - " button , the price stays - it does not reset to the amount
in product properties until you logout .
sorting - you can sort by any field on the products tab simply by clicking on
the title of the field . for multiple sorts , hold down your " shift " key .
parent products which are at the top of a stack do not have their basis
relationship identified . ( e . g . the product bar might before have said : " basis
link - parent " and now would say " stand alone , parent " ) .
detailed feature descriptions
multiple children
the new version of enrononline allows you to link several products together
in a long chain . for example , child product a can be linked to parent product
b , which is in turn linked to parent product c .
warning : although there is no absolute limit to the number of links in a
chain , system performance is degraded by large chains . this is because when a
customer attempts a transaction , the database must " lock " each and every
product in the chain before it can process the transaction request . the
database must then update the stack for each product before releasing the
locks . " vertical " chains ( multiple parents and children in one long link ) are
much slower to process than " flat " chains ( one parent with many children ) .
large vertical chains should be avoided .
related to this feature is the ability to have several types of links on the
same parent . for example , child product a can have a basis link to parent
product b . at the same time , child product c can have a syncopated basis link
to the same parent product b . parent b is the parent for both a syncopated
basis link and a regular basis link .
static product bar prices
the new version of enrononline provides for " sticky " product bar price and
volume changes . when you change a number on the product bar , it does not
reset to the number contained in the product properties menu until after you
have logged out . this makes it easier to update prices , volumes , spreads or
offsets in a changing market without repeated hits to the " + " or " - " buttons .
one of the benefits of setting these numbers to appropriate levels is that it
reduces repeated price movements . with the old version of stack manager , if
the price delta was too small , traders would often repeatedly hit the price
movement buttons . each of these price changes must be communicated across the
website to customers and consumes valuable bandwidth . this makes it harder
for customers to transact with us - each time they try , a new price update
moves the price , resulting in an increased transaction failure rate . entering
an appropriate price into the price delta field and then pressing the price
movement button means that fewer ( but larger ) price movements are necessary ,
improving overall system response and reducing customer transaction failure
rate .
you may also notice a new addition to the product bar prices - a new field
for offset to last trade . this allows you to update the offset for products
which have offset to last trade selected from the product properties menu .
sorting / selecting
the new version of enrononline provide significant additional sorting
functionality over the old . you can now choose any field heading ( type ,
location , reference period , etc . ) and sort by that item . you can do multiple
sorts by holding down the shift key . example : if you select type and then
location while holding the shift key , you will see your products sorted first
by product type and then within each product type , by location ( in
alphabetical order ) .
if you right click on the product menu , you can choose from the same sort
criteria , plus you can select " sort by web order " , which allows you to see
your products in the same order as they would appear to a customer on the
website ( note however , that a customer on the website might be also seeing a
number of products in addition to the ones you are managing ) .
when you select products , you can drag your mouse while holding down the left
mouse button as always , but now you can also hold down the key while
making your selections . this allows you to highlight products which are not
necessarily adjacent to one another .
parent products and f / x products
one of the differences in the way that the new version works is in its
treatment of how parent products are displayed . the old version showed the
type of link associated with the parent in the product bar ( to the left of
the main product bar update buttons above the products tabs ) . the new version
does not show the type of link . this is because the new version allows for
more than one type of link on each parent product .
some traders may notice that their products which have f / x links are now
identified with a stylised " fx " in the product list . this is to enable easy
identification of products which are run as a foreign exchange link to the
parent , rather than managed individually .
assistance
as always , if you have any problems with any enrononline functionality ,
please contact the 24 hour help desk ( houston : 713 853 4357 , london : + 44 ( 0 )
20 7783 7783 , australia : + 61 2 9229 2300 ) .
general feedback
if you have any comments on the new functionality , or suggestions for further
functionality , please call david forster on 713 853 1861 . if you had
previously suggested new functionality which didn ' t make it into this
release , rest assured that you have not been forgotten - we are working hard
to improve all elements of enrononline and will try to incorporate your
requests into the next release of the enrononline stack manager .Subject: kingwood cove - $ 10 before 10 am !

i spoke to mr . maldinado this morning and it doesn ' t look good . he claims he
has a connection to the minister of " energy " who will allocate gas to him . i
asked where would the gas be delivered , and he said anywhere you want it .
short term or long term ? again , anything you want , but probably long term is
better .
i pointed out that there isn ' t an energy minister in saudi and would he know
the name of the minister whose giving him the gas ? he stumbled and couldn ' t
remember the name .
finally he said " what do you have to lose ? just send me a letter requesting
gas with the specs , location and duration " and he ' ll do his best to get it .

aquila split the volume between two points , that is why the deal changed .
the total volume was still correct . i just found out today , from stacie ,
that a buy on eol needs to be on the header and come from a pgev hub or title
tracking agreement . i had previously been under the impression that
whatever pipeline the customer wanted , buy or sell , was fine with us .
however , keeping the purchases on hub agmts . will save enron

katherine
as i told thu before ( see below ) , i did not see any volumes for that deal
in 4 / 00 . i think this volume is some residue that flow from the last day in
march and probably should be allocated to that month . i dont show a deal to
purchase or sell that gas in april . if you have any more questions please let
me know , thanks .

katherine ,
this is a brokered deal ( buy deal 231758 and sell deal 93472 ) . this first
day was not pathed , that ' s why you are missing volume of 271 . per carlos
( see below ) the deal was not for day one .

in regards to meter 098 - 4179 the following information is what i have been
able to determine from the information available to me .
to your questions :
1 . cannot determine who owns this meter . i will contact molly carriere on
monday when she returns .
2 . hpl has a fifty ( 50 ) ft . easement at this location which does contain
language for appurtenance rights within the 50 ' .
3 . i pulled the meter file for this location which was prepared during
project rock and it does not contain a facility agreement so i am assuming
one was not located .
hope this helps .

attached is a contract preparation request for a facilities agreement for the

legal department has prepared and is currently circulating a ratification and

we have been unable to locate an existing facility agreement for the 3

the facility agreement requested herein is intended to cover only alterations
to be made to existing meter 098 - 4179 to install an h 2 s monitor and necessary
valving to allow hplc to accept gas from the newly drilled albrecht # 4 well .
once the h 2 s monitor has been installed and the albrecht # 4 well is ready to
flow , we intend to paper the purchase of gas from the albrecht # 4 well only
via a spot confirmation pursuant to a spot gtc . the albrecht # 4 will not be
covered by 96008903 , nor will the wells currently subject to 96008903 be
subject to the spot gtc .
coastal will reimburse hplc $ 39 , 600 for the cost of the installation .

the newly drilled coastal oil in may , 2000 , the meter flowed about 960
mmbtu / d of 3 . 36 % co 2 gas .
the content of the albrecht # 4 gas according to the field gas analysis
prepared by coastal oil the albrecht # 4 h 2 s content
is similar to that of the three wells currently producing 960 mmbtu / d behind
meter 098 - 4179 , the miller - albrecht unit # 1 - a and the hoff heller gas unit
# 1 a & # 2 d . coastal further purports that for some time now it ( and / or its
predecessor , mjg , corp . ) has treated these three wells for h 2 s in a manner
sufficient to reduce the h 2 s content delivered into hplc to permissible
levels . coastal has further indicated that it intends to reduce the h 2 s
content of the albrecht # 4 to permissible levels before delivering same to
hplc . in your opinion , should coastal be forced to install an h 2 s monitor
for this new gas prior to flowing same to hplc ?

in regards to meter 098 - 4179 the following information is what i have been
able to determine from the information available to me .
to your questions :
1 . cannot determine who owns this meter . i will contact molly carriere on
monday when she returns .
2 . hpl has a fifty ( 50 ) ft . easement at this location which does contain
language for appurtenance rights within the 50 ' .
3 . i pulled the meter file for this location which was prepared during
project rock and it does not contain a facility agreement so i am assuming
one was not located .
hope this helps .

as evidenced by an exceptionally strong performance in the second quarter ,
enron  , s wholesale energy businesses in north america and europe continue to
experience tremendous growth . the opportunities to continue to grow our
natural gas and power businesses have never been better and it is critical to
enron  , s future success that we remain focused on expanding these businesses
and maintaining the strong momentum we have in these markets .
it is equally important that we continue to develop new businesses outside of

growth . we have made significant progress in developing these businesses in
north america , europe , and most recently in our new net works business unit .
included in these global businesses are our efforts in crude and products ,
coal , emissions , insurance , currency , equity trading , interest rates , credit
trading , paper and pulp , and metals .

accelerate the growth of these new businesses while continuing to
aggressively expand our core gas and electricity businesses in north america

the increasingly global opportunities in these new businesses we are today
announcing the formation of a new business unit  ) enron global markets . this

- insurance and weather : jere overdyke

announce the following appointments in that business unit :
- jeff mcmahon : president and chief operating officer
- louise kitchen : chief commercial officer

anita ,
if you are no longer handling this meter , please pass this email on to the
correct person .
for meter # 6563 , i have meter statements showing that volume did flow for
12 / 99 - 4 / 00 production on this meter . i am not seeing this volume in volume
management for these production months . for 5 / 00 and 6 / 00 production , the
volumes are there . is the reason because a deal number needs to be set up ?
please let me know .

it apppears that any deliveries made during the time frame from 12 / 99 -

therefore , vance explained to me that the volume of 1 , 517 dth for the period
should have been allocated to the strangers agreement , just as it was . any
deliveries were unauthorized ( udog ) and the gas then belongs to hpl . please
give vance a call if you have any further questions regarding this issue .

fyi
this is a reduction in total capacity from 528 , 000 to 400 , 000 at station 809 .
hpl has typically been running about 180 , 000 to 200 , 000 mmbtu through station
809 in august . we can pull more gas off of the a - s line at swan lake to keep
our throughput around the 175 , 000 .
my original conversation with epfs was that the capacity would be limited to
around 400 , 000 mmbtu total during the maintenance . station 809 will be down
through the weekend and we will get a better picture of how much we can move
without 809 running . i will visit with epfs on monday and see if we can get
the volume bumped up ( to 400 , 000 ) and adjust on tuesday as necessary .

subject : re : meter # : 1266 ; august 2000 / allocation exception
conoco has nominated 5 . 0 / d at this meter . conoco transport can be allocated
the entire meter flow for the days in which the meter flow
exceed 5 . 0 mm because they are the only party doing business at the meter .
hpl may also be able to extract a sell for this overage which is why i
wanted you to be aware of the daily activity thus far .

here is the issue for 1 / 16 / 99 at meter 984132 .
20 , 000 mmbtu were confirmed for adonis in pops . 10 , 000 mmbtu on day 5 and
day 16 . day 16 is not valid for deal 51862 ( track id 6155 ) , which is where
10 , 000 was confirmed . the actual sale to adonis was 10 , 000 which was
invoiced and paid by adonis . we are trying to clear the feedback error
report . my question is why was 10 , 000 confirmed on 1 / 16 / 99 if the date is
not valid for the deal ?
when karen allocates the actual 10 , 000 it is prorating 5 , 000 for each day
that is confirmed ( the 5 th and 16 th ) .
should the whole 10 , 000 be allocated to the 5 th or should 5 , 000 be allocated
to each day ? if 5 , 000 should be allocated to each day , the 16 th needs to be
added to the deal .Subject: re : feedback monitor error - meter 984132 - 1 / 99

karen ,
i realize this . it appears as if you ' re asking me to have day 16 added to
the sitara deal ticket so that all volumes that flowed for that day can
allocate to this deal .
maybe you might want to phone me if this is not the case .

subject : re : feedback monitor error - meter 984132 - 1 / 99
i am uncomfortable putting a deal out there without more details . here are
my questions :
1 ) why was this gas just discovered now ? and where has it been hiding ?
2 ) adonis is a wmbe which means he has a direct pay agreement so never pays
for gas taken . we have to invoice
the actual burner for this gas ( hl & p , tu , cp & l , etc ) . can we identify end
user and see if they paid for this gas or will have to pay .
3 ) adonis has skipped town and is no longer in business . hl & p told me he
got paid for gas that never was delivered ( rumor ) .
how can we invoice him now ?
4 ) 60 , 000 mmbtu seems like a high volume of gas to slip through the cracks
for almost two years . answer the above questions and
i will be glad to approve this .

what does mops show for the days in question ? it would be incorrect to add
any days to the adonis ticket mentioned below . it sounds as if the meter was
allocated incorrectly in pops and / or a deal was not pathed correctly in
mops . let me know what you find in mops .

on day 5 in mops ( hpl / ena ) there is a delivery nom of 10 . 0 pathed to the ena
201 k . on day 16 in mops ( hpl / ena ) there is not a deal ( which is strange
because day 16 in pops references adonis ) . the deal on the 5 th was a swing
deal .

jackie ,
what does mops show for the days in question ? it would be incorrect to add
any days to the adonis ticket mentioned below . it sounds as if the meter was
allocated incorrectly in pops and / or a deal was not pathed correctly in
mops . let me know what you find in mops .

subject : meter 984132 for 1 / 16 / 99
here is the issue for 1 / 16 / 99 at meter 984132 .
20 , 000 mmbtu were confirmed for adonis in pops . 10 , 000 mmbtu on day 5 and
day 16 . day 16 is not valid for deal 51862 ( track id 6155 ) , which is where
10 , 000 was confirmed . the actual sale to adonis was 10 , 000 which was
invoiced and paid by adonis . we are trying to clear the feedback error
report . my question is why was 10 , 000 confirmed on 1 / 16 / 99 if the date is
not valid for the deal ?
when karen allocates the actual 10 , 000 it is prorating 5 , 000 for each day
that is confirmed ( the 5 th and 16 th ) .
should the whole 10 , 000 be allocated to the 5 th or should 5 , 000 be allocated
to each day ? if 5 , 000 should be allocated to each day , the 16 th needs to be
added to the deal .Subject: attention all basketball players

what does mops show for the days in question ? it would be incorrect to add
any days to the adonis ticket mentioned below . it sounds as if the meter was

here is the issue for 1 / 16 / 99 at meter 984132 .
20 , 000 mmbtu were confirmed for adonis in pops . 10 , 000 mmbtu on day 5 and
day 16 . day 16 is not valid for deal 51862 ( track id 6155 ) , which is where
10 , 000 was confirmed . the actual sale to adonis was 10 , 000 which was
invoiced and paid by adonis . we are trying to clear the feedback error
report . my question is why was 10 , 000 confirmed on 1 / 16 / 99 if the date is
not valid for the deal ?
when karen allocates the actual 10 , 000 it is prorating 5 , 000 for each day
that is confirmed ( the 5 th and 16 th ) .
should the whole 10 , 000 be allocated to the 5 th or should 5 , 000 be allocated
to each day ? if 5 , 000 should be allocated to each day , the 16 th needs to be
added to the deal .Subject: re : valero - - meter 8018

elizabeth ,
sorry , i can ' t remember if we had talked about this pricing issue or what .
were you looking into this issue for me or was it passed to someone else .
please see the email below . i believe the system is pulling in the wrong
price for waha . wtx . if . m . i . . for 5 / 00 production . the deal # is 250237 .
i looked at the publication and it shows that the price should be $ 2 . 95 .
the price of $ 2 . 95 plus $ 1 would equal the price of $ 2 . 96 which is what duke
is
claiming the price to be instead of what we are showing which is $ 3 . 95 .

donna and i researched your list and identified the ones that were on system

create ) .
standard pooling stations and west texas ( line x ) pooling stations had no
meters , so they are not set up .

daren , there were several points on your list that were previously created
and the remainder have been created , with the exception explained below .
donna and i researched your list and identified the ones that were on system
( which she would create ) and the ones that were off system ( which i would
create ) .
standard pooling stations and west texas ( line x ) pooling stations had no
meters , so they are not set up .
the hunt fairway plant ( 17 - 8477 - 01 ) was previously created as ( 178477 ) , i
need to know if the ( 01 ) needs to be added .
we need to verify hpl - texoma ( 17 - 0973 - 13 ) , it is set up as ( 17097613 ) . is
this the same point ? ? ?
please let donna and myself know how to proceed with the ones in red .

10 , 000 should be allocated to adonis # 51862 on the 5 th only . nothing should
be allocated or confirmed for adonis on the 16 th . additionally , it looks
like 5000 was confirmed as a receipt from mitchell ( track id 3167 ) on the
16 th . this should be - 0 - also . by taking the conf / allocation for adonis
( track id 6155 ) and mitchell ( track id 3167 ) to zero on the 16 th , the meter
balance remains the same and the bridge errors will be cleared .

jackie ,
what does mops show for the days in question ? it would be incorrect to add
any days to the adonis ticket mentioned below . it sounds as if the meter was
allocated incorrectly in pops and / or a deal was not pathed correctly in
mops . let me know what you find in mops .

here is the issue for 1 / 16 / 99 at meter 984132 .
20 , 000 mmbtu were confirmed for adonis in pops . 10 , 000 mmbtu on day 5 and
day 16 . day 16 is not valid for deal 51862 ( track id 6155 ) , which is where
10 , 000 was confirmed . the actual sale to adonis was 10 , 000 which was
invoiced and paid by adonis . we are trying to clear the feedback error
report . my question is why was 10 , 000 confirmed on 1 / 16 / 99 if the date is
not valid for the deal ?
when karen allocates the actual 10 , 000 it is prorating 5 , 000 for each day
that is confirmed ( the 5 th and 16 th ) .
should the whole 10 , 000 be allocated to the 5 th or should 5 , 000 be allocated
to each day ? if 5 , 000 should be allocated to each day , the 16 th needs to be
added to the deal .Subject: re : oasis pipe line company

hey guys and girls ,
?
here ' s an idea for an icebreaker activity for our 2 nd week of neon . ? this is
only an idea , you can use it or do something totally different . ? again , let
me know along the way if you have something that has worked well for your
group so we can share in the wealth .
?
someone in your group should have a couple of classic books full of
icebreaker - game type of activities , building community in youth groups , and
youth group trust builders . ? we all at one time had a selection of
icebreakers in a gray binder that you might still have somewhere in a
drawer . ? spend time in the games and forced interactions , especially over
the beginning of the semester . ? if you don ' t have these resources , let me
know . ? even if some of these ideas may seem familiar to you , remember that
you may have been doing this far longer than the oldest kids have been in
your group . ? but again , if you have any ideas for resources let me know .
?
in addition to the ideas to think about at the top of the 2 nd weeks topic , a
couple of additional thoughts given me by leaders :
? ? ? - realize and possibly communicate in a low key manner to the freshman
that their expectations of neon may not initially be met . ? they may be
coming in with ideas of what neon is , only to possibly be disappointed . ? in
a sense it is similar to going to a restaurant or movie after tons of people
have recommended it to you , and being a little let down . ? more importantly ,
they need to realize that neon is not an event , it is a process . ? the teens
who say they love it are most often the ones who have been in it long enough
to have built relationships and to have shared a bunch of common
experiences . ? with time and a commitment on their part to be at neon weekly ,
their expectations will ultimately be met .
? ? ? - remember that the best quality time you have with the kids is probably
before or after neon , or at other non - neon times .
?
have fun loving on your kids wednesday !
?

subject : possibly adding deal prices to path manager
donna ,
a request was brought up this week that i would like you to run by the
managers for input :
- add the deal price to the sales and supply list windows of path manager
this seems more significant based on the transactions from eol .
this has been mentioned in the past , but has had some related " baggage " :
- impact on performance , may run slower . could make it an option so you pay
the price when you need it .
- ability to show tier info . maybe just use the work " tiered " and not try
to represent the actual pricing
- agreed format for those deals that have index pricing and percentage and
fixed price offset ( ie 98 % of if . transco . znl + . 02 )
this column would be customizable by resizing and relocating it by user
preference .

ed - can you help ? i need to know the term of our existing transport expense
deal with reliant entex to serve the referenced customer . we must have an
existing contract that we can look up . our existing deal to sell to mobil
expires october 1 . i am trying to make a two year sales offer beginning
october 1 . if the transport expires before then , then we ' ll need to call
entex about a transport rate . who is the correct dealmaker to call entex on
this matter ? ? i ' d be happy to do it , but i ' d be stepping on somebody else ' s
turf .
if the existing rate is indeed 5 cents plus 2 . 02 % fuel , that seems kind of
high . it ' s a short haul - according to our field folk , we give the gas to
entex at the la porte city gate , and it goes to the mobil plant at pasadena ,
about 10 miles away at the most .
any and all help appreciated .

it is my sincere honor to once again lead the enron team in this year ' s
juvenile diabetes foundation ( jdf ) walk scheduled to take place on sunday ,
november 5 , 2000 , at the sam houston race park . i continue to serve on the
board of jdf representing enron and will be enron ' s corporate executive for
this year ' s fundraising efforts .
as many of you may already know , i am an insulin dependent diabetic myself .
even though i know how difficult this disease can be to manage with the
multiple finger pricks for blood samples and several shots each day , i cannot
imagine how difficult it is for a small child with this disease . taking
insulin does not cure the disease nor prevent the development of
complications ; insulin is simply their life support system and without it
they would die .
enron continues to be a major corporate sponsor for jdf again this year . jdf
is a very efficient organization in which approximately 84 % of all money
raised goes directly to research . enron ' s goal this year is to raise
$ 225 , 000 and we need your help . enron has been the number 1 walk team for 5
years in a row and we are not ready to give up first place ! we need team
leaders , walkers and volunteers to help us reach our goal . the theme for the
walk this year is " knock out diabetes " and we would like to have you join us
for this great event . the walk is truly a blast and we had about 500 enron
people participate last year and everyone enjoyed it .
if you are interested in volunteering to be a walker or a team leader , or if
you would like to make a pledge , you may call any of the steering committee
members listed below . if you are interested in being a team leader , please
contact one of the following people immediately so that you may be included
in the first important and informative training session taking place this
week .

the only valid " buyback " ticket for meter # : 1373 is sitara ticket # :
246408 . s . ticket # : 156342 is an old ticket which was used to set up
buyback
ticket across equistar ' s meters { 1552 , 1384 , 1062 , 1553 } . if you recall
this process was done to enable client services to automate equistar
allocation / billing . the project took place around april 2000
production retroactive back to jan . 1999 . the link to compute the buyback is
set up
on s . ticket # 246408 .
since equistar has begun doing business via ena , it was necessary to
establish a " buyback ticket " on ena ' s matrix .
thus , to answer your question , yes there should only be one " buyback
ticket " for meter # : 1373 on hpl and ena .
ena activity is kept whole and the swing is on hpl .
i hope i have addressed all of your questions below however , i am
available for follow up discussion if needed .
it has been a pleasure working with you . i learned a lot about the
business while scheduling industrials and thanks for the opportunity .

1 ) i can put the dollar amount in on day 1 as a demand or facility fee .
2 ) i need you to give me volume ( s ) and a price to input into the deal . i

1 . introduction
we are planning to launch version 2 . 0 of enrononline to customers within the
next few days . in preparation for this launch , the new web site will be
released to internal users in north america on wednesday , september 13 th .
european internal users will be launched shortly after north america .
external customers will follow a few days later .
one of the purposes of the internal launch is to simulate the system load
which will be caused by the full customer launch . accordingly , we appreciate
your cooperation in helping us to simulate this load by logging into
http : / / prod . enrononline . com ( no www . ) this is a live web site and all trades
are real .
new features ( as per recent presentations and training sessions ) include :
? price limit orders
? enhanced customization
? floating windows
? market news and quotes
? weather maps and tables
? industry - specific publications
? market - specific homepages
2 . version 2 . 0 launch date
enrononline version 2 . 0 will be launched to the public a few days after our
internal launch . we will be using the new version internally from wednesday ,
sept . 13 . this will provide an opportunity for you to become familiar with
using the new application in the production environment before our customers
start to use it .
3 . new website feature details
price limit orders : customers have the ability to set up orders that
automatically execute as soon as the price and volume requested become
available . the limit orders remain open in the system until they are
executed , cancelled by the user , or when they expire . all pending orders will
expire no later than 12 hours after being placed .
pending price limit orders will appear in a new window below the quotes
screen in the website .
product tabs : enrononline users can use enhanced filtering capabilities to
create separate page tabs for the products that interest them . users can
instantly access each page tab with a click of their mouse . sort ordering can
be changed by clicking on a column heading , with multiple sorts possible by
holding down the shift key while clicking .
floating windows : users have the ability to create multiple windows with
different products by right - clicking on the products in the main quotes
screen .
market news : website users can now access the latest headlines , sports and
industry news from reuters . furthermore , the information categories can be
customized according to personal interests . to customize a particular
category , users need to click the edit button in the category heading .
all information categories can be collapsed to save space . to expand or
collapse a category , users need to click the arrow to the left of the
category heading .
stock quotes : enrononline now offers stock quotes ( 20 min . delay ) from major
exchanges around the world .
weather insights : customers can now access weather maps and temperature data
for specific cities and regions . weather forecasts , up to six days ahead ,
and temperature differentials from periodic averages are now available .
industry publications : website users can read a wide range of
industry - specific publications including argus european natural gas , argus
european electricity , the news from ngi  , s daily gas price index , bandwidth
desk , coal daily and more .
4 . new stack manager features
the stack manager has been updated to facilitate price limit orders . you will
notice that there is a new button at the top of the stack manager , which will
open a window showing a summary of the best price limit order bids and offers
against your managed products . you can click the " + " sign to the left of a
summary to show a list of all the price limit orders which have been placed
against that product .
under normal circumstances , the price shown on the website will be the same
as the price on your stack manager . however , the system will not allow you to
show a price which is better than an existing price limit order . instead , the
system will show a price on the website equivalent to the prevailing price
limit order while it is being filled . once the appropriate price limit orders
are filled , then the website will again show your stack manager prices .
it is important that you complete the  & maximum volume  8 field in the product
properties window and that you select " allow price limit orders " . also , make
sure that the price tick window in the stack manager  , s  & product properties  8
field is appropriate for the product . if you do not do this , your customers
will not be able to use price limit orders for your products .
5 . your participation
please log in to http : / / prod . enrononline . com ( no www . ) on wednesday . to
ensure enrononline version 2 . 0 is a success , it is important that you have a
full understanding of the new features and help promote the system to your

salaries , salaries , salaries ! ! ! everyone is having problems .
unfortunately , many of
you are new to your jobs and did not inherit paperwork to know what your
staff ' s salary is . i have the average
salary for each of the different staffing levels . i have asked the hr
department to also give me
the low and the high . let ' s face it - your staff today and their salary most
likely are not what
they are going to be next year ! to much movement of people . so using
estimates and averages
will probably be as accurate as using current salary levels .
here ' s what you can do :
1 ) make a list of your staff just their positions .
2 ) then put down if you think i should budget high , mid , average , low , low to
average , etc .
you can guess at this based on their experience , length of time in that
position , etc .
3 ) then i will calculate out an estimated salary to use for your budget .
4 ) here is the average :
sr . $ 4 , 961
spec $ 3 , 964
staff $ 3 , 026
sr . clrk $ 2 , 548
clerk $ 2 , 264
asst $ 3 , 162
your list would look something like this :
assistant average
clerk very high
sr . clerk low
specialist low to average
specialist average
sr . specialist average to high
analyst ( they are all allocated at the same amount )
you can , however , use the exact amounts if you have them . it ' s up to you .
next item - training ! ! !
here ' s what you can do :
1 ) list your staff and the type of class they need
2 ) if you don ' t know the exact class you want to send them to , then list what
type
of class - for example personal enrichment ( i . e . time management ) or
technical ( derivatives or applied finance or wellhead to burnertip )
3 ) the personal enrichment classes cost aroung $ 500 - $ 700
4 ) the technical classes cost aroung $ 800 - $ 1000 .
5 ) just list the type of class , and i ' ll do the rest .
next item - headhunters !
try 20 % of the new hires salary for their fees .
other stuff - i have made a list of all of the unusual items we do during the
year that
people forget about at budget time ( i . e . flowers for secretaries day , birthday
ice cream , offsite meeting costs , customer gifts ) . if you forget these
items , i will
make sure it is added to your budget .
once i put all of your budget information into the spreadsheets , we will
review them
so that they can be adjusted as necessary and you can approve them . hopefully
this helps you some .

here ' s the latest global performance management schedule for ye 2000 and some
friendly reminder tips for you and your direct reports . the system is
scheduled to open for feedback in 35 days . please forward all mid - year 2000
evaluations to janet de la paz at eb 3658 a .
july 31 - oct 13 th development & testing
oct . 2 - 13 th training - hr community
oct 9 - 27 th training - all employees

nov . 17 th system closes for feedback
nov . 20 th prc meetings begin
dec . 15 th prc meetings conclude
jan 4 - 5 th executive committee meeting
reminders
request that employees maintain an updated list of their acheivements and
contributions to your group . tell them the information they forward to you
will better help you in representing them .
the focus of the prc this year will remain on development of the employee and
will emphasize comparing everyone within a particular peer group relative to
everyone else in their peer group .
update your documentation of employee performance and communicate the key
highlights of their performance or lack thereof now with your direct reports
so that the evaluation process creates minimal or no surprises for your
direct report . it is much easier to have a constructive evaluation session
with your direct report if he / she already knows what the key areas of needed
development are . an ideal situation for the supervisor is one in which
employees with performance issues ( can ' t do or won ' t do ) choose to exit the
group voluntarily before the self evident evaluation has to be given .
i will continue to provide updates and reminders as they become available .
let me know if you have any questions .

the database for august is now ready for viewing . just as a reminder , this
is the shortcut on your desktop called " statistical database " .
as there is continued investor focus on our wholesale operations , investor
relations requests that business analysis & reporting provide monthly
volumetric analysis for wholesale operations in addition to the quarterly
analysis . please review the analysis for august 2000 and provide
explanations for all material changes ( + / - 10 % ) for the year / year ,
quarter / quarter , and month / month variances . the current objective of
investor relations is to use this analysis as a resource to answer potential
investor or analyst questions , but it may be used for ad hoc requests and
presentations . it is essential that the volumes be verified by commercial
personnel .
please forward your verification and explanations via e - mail to me by 10 : 00 am

that this material is only one part of what needs to be happening in your

one of the icebreaker activities you have ( even if it seems cheesy ) or
somehow ask questions and get the group talking with each other or about
themselves .
?

with you and it appeared that some of the financial terms of the gas
management agreement were yet to be worked out - - has that occurred yet ? do you
know the details of the extension on the transition agreement ? are you
available to meet on this in the next day or two and is there anyone else you

subject : profit center request formSubject: important information about united healthcare - please read !
to : houston area employees participating in the domestic medical plan benefits
you may have recently received communication from united healthcare ( uhc )
concerning memorial hermann health systems ' ( mhhs ) decision to terminate
their contract with uhc in the houston / beaumont area . this communication
also included the names of physicians who will be dropped from the network
due to this action . it is our intent to help you understand the situation .
it is our understanding that memorial herman health systems asked for a 40 %
increase in fees - a substantial increase that would have been passed on to
you and enron ! when united healthcare attempted to negotiate with a counter
proposal , memorial hermann cancelled their contract .
while this contractual arrangement was between the hospital system and uhc ,
enron continues to support uhc in their ongoing contract negotiation
efforts . at this time , it is only uhc which has been affected , however , it
is our understanding that cigna has also been contacted by the hospital group
and may be in contract negotiations at this time as well .
many doctors have obtained admission privileges to other area hospitals
within the uhc network or have contracted directly with uhc including those
with admission privileges to the woodlands , sugarland and clear lake
hospitals , to name a few . in a further effort to limit disruption to our
affected employees and families who are enrolled in the uhc network or epo
options , enron has authorized uhc to process claims incurred between
september 28 and december 31 , 2000 as if the termination of the memorial
hermann health systems from the network had not occurred and in - network
benefits applied . office visits will have a $ 10 copayment and all other
charges will be covered at 90 % . hospital admissions will still need to be
pre - certified with uhc .
these steps have decreased the number of participants ' affected by primary
care physician disruption from 1 , 050 to 127 .
if you need medical attention : you or your doctor / hospital must call uhc ' s
customer service number so proper benefits can be verified . in some cases
the hospital or doctor may request payment at the time service is performed .
if this should happen , please obtain an itemized statement and submit it to
uhc with a claim form for prompt reimbursement . claim forms can be obtained
by calling 1 - 800 - 332 - 7979 or in houston at 713 - 853 - 7979 ( press 1 ) .
open enrollment materials will be coming soon . take this opportunity to
consider your elections for 2001 .
united healthcare and enron hr are committed to assisting enron employees
through this transition . we will communicate any further developments that
may impact you or your family .Subject: union carbide - seadrift
fyi - did a baseload deal with union carbide at seadrift hpl meter # 1332 for
octo 0 that will require some coordination with terry calvert of union
carbide , who can be reached at 713 - 973 - 5665 . i want to pass on details in

daren & tom ,
beginning with august production , i noticed that big cowboy , into king ranch
appeared to be flowing approximately 9 m over the nomination / day . per a
conversation i had with fred boas today , i discovered that two wells with
zero noms flowed a considerable volume .
they are as follows :
rocher big cowboy ( 27002 ) - 42 , 000 approx .
big cowboy # 2 ( 27003 - 84 , 000 approx .
total flow : 126 , 000 mm ' s , more or less
i think that this may be part of the production increase which we are trying
to account for , in addition to the acock production at the briscoe well which
came on in august . please let me know what you think . i would like to make
sure that we are capturing our purchases correctly for both accounting and
our economics .

dSubject: re : october wellhead
the heatherlock deal had a single transaction agreement attached to it . when
the contract ended the deal ended .
the other two i believe we just need a email from vance or donald setting up
a spot ticket .
vance could you look into that ? do i have the wrong contract attached ? or
is there a new contract . for camden & north central , are those just going to
be spot tickets ?

dSubject: re : big cowboy for august
mary :
is the issue below confirmed volumes versus actual flow ? the large variance
between confirmed and actuals began in june 2000 where 30 mmbtu was scheduled
for dix ranch and zero for the big cowboy and big cowboy # 2 wells . it
appears that the volumes for these wells were scheduled at despain where
985 , 350 mmbtu was confirmed . this well has never flowed this much volume ,
and in june 2000 it flowed approximately 320 , 000 mmbtu . do we actually have
support ( i . e we talked with someone or have a nom sheet ) for the 985 , 350
mmbtu that was entered into mops as confirmed ? this trend of " nothing " being
confirmed at these three wells continued until july 2000 . in august 2000
this scenario changed and 612 , 388 was confirmed at dix ranch and nothing was
scheduled at the big cowboy and big cowboy # 2 wells .
from reading your memo below it also appears that more volume is flowing at
these wells that we expected . if the issue is an actual increase in the
volumes flowing at these wells , i would suggest that you call our gas
measurement department and ask them to audit coral ' s charts . coral may be is
calculating the volumes incorrectly .
this could also be an allocations issue . the allocation as it is in the
system today closely agrees with the allocation statement that i receive
monthly from karen lambert at tejas . the only differences between the tejas
schedule and what is in mops are the acock production and gain or loss which
are not scheduled and therefore not allocated . i know that you are working
on the acock production and tom acton and i are working on the gain / loss .
tom will tell me how to path the gas so that i can set up accounting
arrangements for april 1999 forward . scheduling will have analyze and
possibly rework january through march 1999 because these months were
originally set up in pops .
i want to help , so if i have missed the issue ( s ) would you please clarify it
or them for me and let me know if i need to do anything for you .
thanks ,

subject : big cowboy for august
daren & tom ,
beginning with august production , i noticed that big cowboy , into king ranch
appeared to be flowing approximately 9 m over the nomination / day . per a
conversation i had with fred boas today , i discovered that two wells with
zero noms flowed a considerable volume .
they are as follows :
rocher big cowboy ( 27002 ) - 42 , 000 approx .
big cowboy # 2 ( 27003 - 84 , 000 approx .
total flow : 126 , 000 mm ' s , more or less
i think that this may be part of the production increase which we are trying
to account for , in addition to the acock production at the briscoe well which
came on in august . please let me know what you think . i would like to make
sure that we are capturing our purchases correctly for both accounting and
our economics .

imbalances :
i would like us to continue to pursue channel / el paso / tenngasco for our
payback . they got our cashout number last week , where do they stand .
again , i think robert is an ally and i do not want to irritate him but
things will not get any better in the future . we need to resolve this
imbalance . can we net some of these contracts ?
i like mary poorman ' s report ; however i have questions :
how can we miss black marlin so completely ? do we agree with this imbalance ?
can we net all the chevron and dynegi contracts together for payback to
keith once we get the ar issue solved ?
where do we stand on the columbia energy resolution ?
where do we stand on the ngpl reconcilliation ?
duke energy 206 is still a problem .
do we need all these amoco contracts they have 8 , that seems like a large
number to me , can we net some of them ?
are we charging enough for the swing we get at the paper plant on the entex
contract ?
is there a way to keep tejas in line at southern union this winter ? that
meter will really swing then and i do not know how much line pack they have
the right to use .
can we net the corpus christi gas marketing and all the tejas / coral / gulf
energy / shell imbalances down ? how is the reconcillitation going ?
can we smash the entex and the reliant contracts together so we can get rid
of some of these contracts ? they have 9 , that seems like a lot to me .
gulfmark is gone down the road can we check with someone about this
contract , it seems like we should be able to net these volumes against some
where we are owed ?
is this lone star 213 imbalance real , if so how do we resolve ?
where did the exxon imbalance come from ?
do we need 5 texaco transportation contracts , can we get rid of some ?
can we combine the vastar and the southern imbalances ?
what is the webb / duval do , can we get rid of it , combine this with midcon ,
how old is this imbalnce ?
mick update the compressor fuel on the p / l but the new numbers do not seem to
translate up to the profit calculation ? can we do something about this ?
i thought the imbalance report i got this wed was pretty sad . some of the
columns did not add and there seemed to be a lot of missing information . can
we resolve this ?
i am concerned about our capacity positons in the future , we are going to
have to work on a better way to check our positions .
i had a meeting with tom shelton and our representative to the rrc , james
mann , the rrc is concerned about this winter and they have asked us to
compile a list of customers we will cut based upon the priority we filed with
the rrc several years ago . lauri will have a copy of the priority list . we
need to compile this list and get tom and james comfortable with the
process . the last thing we need is the rrc hammering on us , when can we get
this list ? i think we should be able to get something out of the contract
system . jackie morgan is who i would approach .Subject: cornhusker contract information

i am taking over the duke account from katherine and am having trouble with
8 / 00 production . it looks like we have some spot deals included in the
exchange deal 157288 . i think days 9 - 31 , which are priced at gd - 0 . 10 ,
need to be moved to a new ticket if they are spot . let me know if you
agree . also , can you confirm for me that days 8 / 5 and 8 / 6 are suppose to be
exchange ? the sale volume for those two days was zero , so there was no
exchange . we have not received any statements from duke yet , so there is
nothing to verify our volumes .
you may also want to look at sept . 2000 for deal 157288 . it looks like spot
deals are being included in the exchange deal . those will need to be moved
to a new ticket if they are spot .

? participation : this program will be available to active regular full - time
and regular part - time employees of enron and its wholly owned subsidiaries ;
however , employees of some enron companies ( portland general electric , eott ,
enron facility services ) may not be able to participate due to legal ,
accounting , tax , labor or business reasons . eligibility includes being
employed at the time of implementation .
? timing : u . s . employee sign - up will begin in early 2001 , with delivery of
the equipment and internet connection to follow shortly thereafter . delivery
of equipment to participating non - u . s . employees is targeted for late 2001 .
details about this program are still being finalized . to address some of
your initial questions , we  , ve posted a question - and - answer document on
http : / / clickathome . enron . com . we will schedule an espeak session in the near
future where you will have an opportunity to ask questions . or , you can
submit your questions and comments to clickathome @ enron . com .
we are excited to extend our investment in technology to you and your
family . we believe this program takes communication at enron to a new level
by creating endless possibilities for you to experience and participate in
the broadband internet revolution . it is just another reason why we believe
enron is a great place to work .Subject: opm survey

i have been billing koch midstream services co under ena for meters
ll - 1 - 0030 - comitas ( sitara # 144052 ) and ll - 1 - 0027 - volpe ( sitara # 144049 ) . my
former accounting contact at koch , michael thomas , said that koch sold these
south texas assets to duke energy field services back in 1999 . michael faxed
a contract which i forwarded to cindy balfour flannigan in the contract
area . cindy said she can ' t tie the deals in the contract to our system so
she can ' t recognize the assignment . cindy has left messages with koch , but
she has not been able to resolve the issue . koch is refusing to pay for
the gas and there is currently over a million dollars outstanding relating to
these deals . i need to find out whether koch or duke is responsible for
paying for this gas . do you have any information regarding this issue ?
thanks ,

liz or stacey - there is flow at meter 74 on 9 / 14 ( 499 dth ) . the deal for
this meter ( 400289 ) did not start until 9 / 15 . could one of you extend the
deal for this ? i would be greatly appreciated .
aimeeSubject: information regarding batch noms on aug 5 , 6 & 7 , 2000
daren :
i am having trouble with 8 / 00 . the first issue is day 1 of the purchase at
fuels cotton . we have two deals in sitara , spot deal 348951 and exchange
deal 157288 . you had said previously that we would know a spot deal had
occurred by the new deal ticket and the different pricing . since there was a
spot deal , we put all of the volume for day 1 on deal 348951 . duke says that
day 1 was not a spot and that it should be on the exchange deal and priced at
gd - 0 . 10 . the exchange deal is currently price at index - 0 . 05 . please let
me know which deal we are suppose to use and what the price should be .
the second issue is the sale volume on deal 157278 for 8 / 00 . duke is telling
me that we sold them a batch of gas on the 7 th , which we see , but that we are
suppose to prorate the gas over the 5 th , 6 th , and 7 th for the exchange . this
is a problem since gas was not confirmed for the 5 th and 6 th and pipeline
shows all of the gas on the 7 th . this is a daily swing meter which
electronically feeds into settlements . we don ' t normally change these
meters . if you intended for us to prorate this gas , i will need your ok . the
emails below are from marta at duke notifying us of the change .

tina ,
koch never returned my calls . based on the contractual information , we may be
putting ourselves in a risk area by ' assigning ' the deals without proper
documentation . the documentation that was supplied did not refence any ena
agreements , nor any specific meter numbers . if the purchase was indeed a
meter / well sale ; there should be documentation listing the meters acquired
and the effective date . since we are apparently the supplier , the risk is not
as substaintial as if we were the purchaser . however , without documentation
we are basically relying on the relationship btw koch & duke .

since koch has told you that they sold the properties to duke , i would say
that duke should be paying us for the gas .
i had heard that koch sold the properties to another counterparty , but i
wasn ' t sure to whom . i either talked or left a message with someone in the
settlements area about two months ago about this after koch informed the
trader that they should not be getting the invoices . however , i never heard
back from anyone .
this is related to the ces acquisition which came online the first of this
year . the deal info we had at the time had this sale booked to koch . i can
change the tickets in sitara to the duke counterparty ( or create new tickets )
today if you need me to , so that we can get the invoice out the door . you
will still need to coordinate with the contract group in getting the correct
contract in place for the deal .

sorry for just now getting back with you . i was out last week .
the rate ( $ . 04 / mmbtu ) will be charged on the greater of the volumes nominated
on the supply contracts or the actual deliveries to the plant . the fee will
be adjusted yearly based on cpi .
bob - i could not remember if we stated the type of settlement on the
delivered volumes ( actuals or nominations ) . i think we should use actuals
due to possibility that the plant could over pull with out our knowledge on a
daily basis . we would receive the estimates / actuals on a lag and may have to
purchase gas to offset the imbalance , even though the plant kept the noms at
the 45 , 000 base . i also think that if the plant does increase the nom , they
are more likely to pull the additional volume rather than pulling less . do
you agree with this ?

tenaska iv has been operating without a " gas agency agreement " since that
portion of the transition agreement expired on august 31 . we met with sandy
and the texas gas desk on september 28 to firm up commercial terms ( which i
think we generally accomplished for all matters other than the price that
would be charged by the desk ) . should we be concerned with the amount of
time this is taking ? that is , is there any risk we face ( bank - wise or

that we are " overproduced " on paper by 76 , 162 dth / mo . i think that we need
to bring the nominations up to balance in sitara at the berryman well and , a
corresponding volume at meters 708 and 6363 , with an offset on strangers to
keep the physical side in line . if my understanding is correct ( and if not ,

subject : gorons
don ' t know who you ' re voting for , but here some things you might want to
consider -
what is a goron
1 . gorons sincerely believe that vice president gore is a true
environmentalist , when he has an environmental disaster on his own farm :
a polluting zinc mine , from which he received $ 500 , 000 of income last
year .
2 . gorons likewise believe that the vp is antismoking and anti - tobacco
when he has operated a tobacco farm for decades and accepted government
subsidies .
3 . gorons truly believe that gore is a vietnam war hero , when in fact
he was placed by family influence in a " cushy " correspondent ' s job and
the only action he saw was that of his brownie camera ! ( and his bong )
4 . gorons actually believe that mr . gore is justified in illegally
raising political funds from the office of the vp , simply because the
vanderbilt law educated vp claims he was ignorant of the illegality .
5 . gorons further believe that it was ok for al to accept large sums
of political money from china through buddhist monks who had taken vows
of poverty , since he again claimed ignorance .
6 . gorons also believe that the man who claimed to " invent the
internet " would be so computationally ignorant that he could lose weeks
of potentially incriminating e - mail !
7 . gorons , incredibly , believe gore ' s claim that he and tipper were
the models for the book and movie , " love story " even though the book ' s
author , erich segal , says not .
8 . gorons , amazingly , believe that gore will be the consumer ' s
champion against high gasoline prices although gore holds a million
dollars in occidental petroleum stock .
9 . gorons applaud mr . lieberman ' s open rejection of president
clinton ' s immorality , but believe it was fine for mr . gore to remain
silent on the subject , while simultaneously declaring mr . clinton " one of
the greatest presidents of our history . "
10 . gorons believe that al gore is an effective leader , when they
won ' t bother to look at his record as a tennessee senator , a record so
ineffective that it has led to the election of republicans as both of
tennessee ' s senators !
11 . gorons hold the belief that gore is a compassionate man who will
be the working man ' s friend , in spite of the eviction notice he served
to the poor family who complained about the conditions of the run down
slum house that he was renting to them .
cautionary note : medical researchers acknowledge that gorons are
generally harmless , except when allowed into a voting booth . there ,
unfortunately , overcome by their gullibility syndrome , they are apt to
actually vote for gore ! they should be carefully protected from their
ailment , since it may be harmful to their well - being , yours , mine and
that of the usa .
therefore , please , heed the surgeon general ' s warning , reach out to
aid the gorons in overcoming the syndrome , and , please , pass this on to
your normal friends , who might also know gorons who need immediate
treatment .Subject: my october newsletter
hello again ,
my monthly newsletter is attached . please read it and let me
know your comments .
according to a survey taken by homegain , homesellers hoping
to turn a biger profit by making home improvements would do
best to stick to moderately priced projects . the survey of
real estate agents from acorss the nation found that home
improvemnts in the $ 80 to $ 2 , 800 range yield the highest
rate of return when the home sells . the biggest return is on
simple lightening and brightening , which typicall costs
about $ 80 - $ 100 and gives an average return of 769 % on the
sale price . other big winners were cleaning and
de - cluttering ( cost = $ 305 - $ 339 ; ; return = 594 % ) , landscaping
and trimming ( cost $ 432 - $ 506 ; return = 266 % ) , and fixing ,
plumbing and electrical ( cost $ 338 - $ 381 ; return = 196 % ) .

marySubject: re : meter 984229 - roos common point - trade zone 18
vance :
per our conversation , we have two possible options to resolve this deal ,
depending on whether the wellheads are producing or not .
producing : if that is the case , the purchase from calpine , and any contracts
hedged to it will need to be backed up in the system to a wellhead level .
once that is done , i will need to research in the system how those wellheads
were allocated and paid and reallocate to your calpine deal . this will
probably have to go back to hplc ' s ownership of hplr ' s gathering assets .
non - producing : should we determine that the common point and any wells
behind it have been shut - in , or p & a ' d , we will need to reallocate this deal
to zero , and unwind any hedges against it ( or , move the hedges to another
deal , if possible . since the deal is older , we probably sold lower priced
contracts against the production and a buy - back today would possibly result
in a financial loss ) .
in either case , the deal needs to be cleaned up back to the date of last flow
at meter 4229 , which i am currently looking into . i will email you as soon
as i ascertain that date .
in lieu of the past couple of days , we may need to look at all of the deals
which were impacted by hplc ' s aquisition of hplr ' s gathering to ensure that
they are being captured properly , both at a book level and at a state filing
level . please let me know what your thoughts are as to how to accomplish
this .
thank you again for all of your hard work in this area ,

vance ,
the issue is that the 4229 meter has been terminated in the system , per
cheryl jones , effective 2 / 00 . therefore , any purchases at that point , for
02 / 00 forward , are ua 4 and are probably having a negative impact on your
accrual . i think perhaps this deal should be backed up to a wellhead level ?
there have not been any measured volumes at 4229 since its termination , so , i
don ' t know where exactly the term calpine deal is , physically . your
assistance in clearing this up is greatly appreciated .
marySubject: re : meter 984229 - roos common point - trade zone 18
mary ,
hplc currently has a gas purchase agreement ( global # 96014987 ) in place with
calpine that extends through 5 / 31 / 2001 . sitara deal no . 133259 correctly has
this contract attached to it . effective 11 / 1 / 1998 the contract was amended
releasing gouger wells no . 5 & 6 . these wells were apparently the only
producing wells behind this point . evidence being no measured volumes in
mips . there are however other non producing wells behind this point . is
your sept
however , they were not added behind meter 6835 . therefore , i do not agree
that the deal ( 133259 ) should be edited to change the meter .
hopefully this information is useful !

christy , i think there is a good chance that the information shown below
went to you , or your office .
i would like to get involved in finalizing plans for revenue distribution
for the n . padre production . i am certain you are way ahead of me on this
matter . spinnaker expects a division order title opining within a few
weeks . i also expect the attorney to make some title requirements which
will delay a final opinion . in talking with ranger and the houston
exploration company , they are prepared to receive their gross ( shown below )
and be responsible to their respective orri owners .
how do you recommend we proceed ? will hpl pay taxes on behalf of the
parties ?
when you get a minute , please call me at 713 / 759 - 1770 .
thanks ,
dan mccue

- hplnl 027 . xlsSubject: spinaker / n . padre island block 883 : allocations
per our various discussions , i am sending an email to reiterate the
disposition of volumes at meter 9862 , the lehman spinaker pay meter . at this
time , the general land office is transporting their share of production
( 21 . 8945 % interest ) and hpl is purchasing the remaining 78 . 1055 % .
the glo has nominated a transport volume at meter 9848 , effective september
1 , 2000 . during this time , some test gas flowed . i have had the hpl
purchase back - dated to coincide with the transport nomination , and have had
both deals moved to 9862 . the meter should probably be designated a
callout / swing so that the proper equity percentages can be allocated after
the production month by volume management .
for october production forward , i am going to re - rank / confirm the pay meter
to ensure that the glo receives a volume which should be close to their
percentage after actuals close for the month . this should alleviate any
large balance swings on their agreement .
anita : for september , i need an accounting arrangement on deal ticket
379424 ; hpl gathering agmt . at meter 9862 . please unallocate the transport
and purchase at 9848 . the meter is a daily swing right now . let me know
when you are ready and i will change the allocation methodology .
i apologize for the length of this email , i want to make sure that we are all
on the same page , to the extent that we need to be , prior to this deal
getting too far down the road . please do not hesitate to call me if you have
any questions , comments , concerns , etc . i am at extension 35251 .

having discussed the matter with brian riley , hpl has no intention of
contacting coastal to negotiate any type of deal affecting the gas received
in september at at meter 4179 . it was brian ' s opinion that the gas should be
considered strangers gas since hpl has no contract or price . it is
suggested that nick moshou contact his counterpart at coastal , relaying this
information and suggesting coastal ' s trader contract brian riley .

nick ,
i understand that they terminated their agreement . however , i don ' t feel
that we can confiscate their production . we need to either pay them for the
gas , or cut a deal to redeliver a like volume to them at another meter .
given the decrease in prices from september to current and prompt month , i
would guess that they want to be paid . we won ' t know that until we call
them . i don ' t know where the responsibility lies as far as calling to
explain to them that we took delivery of their gas until the meter was
shut - in .

marySubject: re : meter 984229 - roos common point - trade zone 18
mary ,
hplc meter number 0984229 was physically remove from service in december ,
1999 . typically , before hpl physically pulls a meter , production has ceased
at minimum for 6 months or the production has been released . in the case of
the roos common point , the producing wells were released and attached to
meter 0989740 in 11 / 98 and the remaining wells are non - producing .
resultingly , the only viable option for resolution is option 2 . we should
take the deal to zero by " unwinding " it .

subject : re : meter 984229 - roos common point - trade zone 18
vance :
per our conversation , we have two possible options to resolve this deal ,
depending on whether the wellheads are producing or not .
producing : if that is the case , the purchase from calpine , and any contracts
hedged to it will need to be backed up in the system to a wellhead level .
once that is done , i will need to research in the system how those wellheads
were allocated and paid and reallocate to your calpine deal . this will
probably have to go back to hplc ' s ownership of hplr ' s gathering assets .
non - producing : should we determine that the common point and any wells
behind it have been shut - in , or p & a ' d , we will need to reallocate this deal
to zero , and unwind any hedges against it ( or , move the hedges to another
deal , if possible . since the deal is older , we probably sold lower priced
contracts against the production and a buy - back today would possibly result
in a financial loss ) .
in either case , the deal needs to be cleaned up back to the date of last flow
at meter 4229 , which i am currently looking into . i will email you as soon
as i ascertain that date .
in lieu of the past couple of days , we may need to look at all of the deals
which were impacted by hplc ' s aquisition of hplr ' s gathering to ensure that
they are being captured properly , both at a book level and at a state filing
level . please let me know what your thoughts are as to how to accomplish
this .
thank you again for all of your hard work in this area ,

mjg assigned the meter to coastal eff . march 2000 . after finally executing
the assignment in mid august , coastal then sent a termination letter eff
9 / 01 / 2000 .Subject: re : coastal ctr # 96008903 meter 0984179 sit # 135714
i checked the meter for september , there are measured volumes of 36 , 085 dth
for the month . the meter had a purchase from mjg at the beginning of the
month . it looks like it was zeroed after the fact . we are going to need to
pay someone for this production . . . . i think we may need to extend the deal
until the point at which the meter was actually shut - in . i do not agree with
allocating this gas to strangers , it is not a true line gain / loss , or a
direct result of any pipe / well work .
please advise so that anita and i can clean this up as promptly as possible .

for 6 / 4 ( 548 dec . ) and 6 / 9 ( 40 dec . ) to cover this flow so that volume

peggy and patricia ,
this is the last allocation exception i have to clear . when you have the
time , could you check the volumes for gas days 28 - 31 for october , 1999 . i
phoned peggy this morning regarding this meter , and apparently it is outside
measured . i need to verify that flow occured so that i can have a deal ( s )
extended to allocate the flow to .
thank you again for all of your assistance , i really appreciate all that you
have done .

3 - 5843Subject: cleco deals 449243 & 397957 / state tract 121 ( meter 785 )
fred or anita ,
i just wanted to recap our discussion to be sure that we are all on the same
page . from my understanding , the allocation for meter 785 : state tract 121
is supplied from bryancy braumley . prior to 09 / 1 / 00 bryancy would calculate
flow from certain wellheads , total this volume , and then send us an
allocation that would show how much gas was allocated to texas general land
and hpl ( sale from cleco ) at meter 785 . effective 09 / 1 / 00 a compressor was
put in and the gas from 785 now flows through this compressor , as well as the
gas from meter 9662 ( deal 137595 sales from dewbre ) , and is now measured at
meter 3527 : tivoli station . for bryancy ' s allocation , she must take the meter
statement from meter 3527 and deduct meter 9662 ' s flow . once this is done ,
she can take that net number and do an allocation between texas general land
and hpl ( cleco ) like she has done previously . i believe meter 785 is now a
check meter and meter 3527 is the actual pay meter .
for 9 / 00 there were two deals in place for the sale from cleco , deal 397957
and 449243 . per discussions with daren farmer , danny conner , and jennifer
martinez , i have been instructed to zero out the deal for 397957 and use
449243 as the correct deal number . therefore , fred boas and i have zeroed
out the 397957 deal and placed the volume that was allocated there to deal
449243 . deal 397957 was priced at ship less . 18 which was incorrect and deal
449243 is priced at ship less . 15 . therefore , an adjustment will generate
for 9 / 00 for the difference in price and the change in location . the
allocated volume for cleco did not change . however , i am not sure that
bryancy is allocating the volume properly between texas general land and hpl
( cleco ) . i have spoke to her , as well as jennifer martinez , and curtis
funderbruk with cleco so there might be some pma ' s for volume differences .
in addition , i have changed the allocation method at meter 3527 to be a
callout \ swing effect 9 / 00 . for october and succeeding months , the volume
should be computed by taking meter 3527 deducting out meter 9662 . then
byancy should take this net number and split it between texas general land
and hpl ( cleco ) . the texas general land nom is currently at meter 785 and
the hpl ( cleco ) deal is at meter 3527 . fred mentioned that the texas general
land nom might need to be moved to meter 3527 but nothing has been decided on
that yet .
please let me know if something i have stated is not your understanding or
you need something more done on my end . also , let me know who is going to be
doing this monthly allocation . it might be beneficial to have one person
doing all the points ( meters 3527 , 9662 , 785 ) . thanks for your help ! ! !Subject: revision # 1 - hpl noms for november 3 , 2000

the lakecreek lateral is baseload for the expected load , the set point may
change up and down in anticipation of weather changes but pressure supply for
entex is provided via the copano 12 " , entex shouldcommunicate with us
directly .

subject : re : copano
that is not what i am conveying . there may be changes made to the set flow
periodically , but it will not be pressure based upon the immediate needs of
the copano pipeline that may be swinging due to some other customer on their
system . whenever entex asks for a new set point at the new woodlands city
gate , our set point at the new bammel interconnect should align with that
same set point so as there is no swing service on the copano pipeline . our
instructions should only come from entex to change the set point , and should
be confirmed with copano . we are not to provide any instantaneous swing
service on the copano lake creek lateral . any swing provided by hpl for the
woodland ' s load will be made into the copano 12 " ( formerly ksc ) line as
historically done . there may be additional capacity needed on the lake creek
lateral because of the revised set point , but that is something that entex
has negotiated with copano independent of hpl . still fuzzy ?

subject : teco ' s indian spring plant
a meeting was held on november 1 , 2000 at 3 pm in eb 3270 to resolve exxon ' s
residue volume issue at teco ' s indian spring plant . exxon ' s issue is that
the residue volumes that hpl is recording for exxon ' s account for
transportation do not equal to the wellhead volumes produced and delivered to
pge .
items that were identified so that exxon ' s issue could be resolved :
1 . hpl is responsible for any ua 4 loss / gain and fuel consumed on pge ' s line
attributable to exxon ' s big sandy production .
2 . if exxon ' s production exceeds 500 mcf / d , hpl must on a monthly basis
elect to process or not process the exxon big sandy gas . if hpl elects
to process , then teco buys the products from hpl .
3 . if exxon ' s production flows between 100 mcf / d and 499 mcf / d , then teco
can process and makeup the shrinkage to hpl with their own gas volumes .
4 . if exxon ' s production is less than 100 mcf / d , then hpl must terminate
the processing agreement . if hpl does not terminate and volume continue
to flow at less that 100 mcf / d than hpl loses the shrinkage and must
pay to teco an additional $ 500 per month .
solution :
1 . hpl will schedule and record the gain / loss volumes at hpl meter # 986884
that is attributable to ua 4 and fuel on the pge line .
2 . hpl will schedule and record the sale volumes of pvr to teco at hpl
meter # 986884 .
3 . the scheduling of the volumes for items 1 and 2 will allow for offset
volumes to be record as adjustments to exxon ' s transport volumes .
4 . the hpl logistics dept . ( mary poorman ) will inform assets group ( jack
simunek ) when and if the volumes nominated for exxon fall below 100 mcf / d .
if any of the above does not reflect what was discussed or agreed to , please
let me know at x - 36650 .

teco tap 30 . 000 / enron ; 71 . 250 / hpl ifercSubject: organizational changes
we are making a number of significant organizational changes . these changes
are intended to accomplish four key objectives :
first , we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successful
business model developed over the last decade in north america and europe .
this model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built
around a relatively small strategic asset position .
second , we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting
relationships . particularly with joe sutton  , s departure , the ability to
directly manage the day - to - day activities of 15 independent business units
has become increasingly difficult .
third , we need to accomplish these changes without , in any way , compromising
the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or
hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower - yielding
asset positions .
and fourth , as always , we need to take advantage of the reorganization to
redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities .
enron wholesale services
today , we are forming enron wholesale services ( ews ) which will consolidate
our global wholesale businesses . the closer alignment of our wholesale
businesses will accomplish the following : ( 1 ) enhanced communication and
coordination across business units , ( 2 ) more rapid deployment of people to
higher valued opportunities , ( 3 ) more effective prioritization of
opportunities across the wholesale business , and ( 4 ) more rapid extension of
enron  , s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries and
markets .
enron wholesale services will include our current north american , european
( including japan and australia ) , global markets , and industrial markets
operations , and will be expanded to include enron  , s net works business unit
as well as a new unit  ) enron global assets . in addition , enron  , s merchant
businesses outside of north america and europe will be integrated into this
new structure as described below .
mark frevert , currently chairman of each of our wholesale units , will assume
the role of chairman and ceo of enron wholesale services . greg whalley ,
currently chairman and ceo of enron net works , will join mark in the office
of the chairman as president and chief operating officer .
providing further impetus for these organizational changes , several of our
international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadership
positions :
rebecca mcdonald , currently ceo of enron apachi , will join ews as president
and ceo of enron global assets . enron global assets will have responsibility
for managing all of enron  , s existing energy asset portfolio outside of north
america and europe . joining rebecca in the office of the chairman as coo
will be jim hughes , currently coo of enron apachi . rebecca and jim will
report to the ews office of the chairman .
sanjay bhatnagar , currently ceo of enron india , has joined ebs as ceo for the
middle east and asia region . sanjay will be responsible for building our
broadband business in this region and the current ebs team in this region
will report to sanjay . in this role , sanjay will report to the ebs office of
the chairman . in addition , sanjay will continue to remain responsible for
enron  , s wholesale energy business in india and will transition this business
into enron global assets in the near future .
diomedes christodoulou , currently co - ceo of enron south america , has joined

ladies and gents :
on sat oct 21 , hpl meter # 1428 had a malfunction , and started flowing at a
very high rate , way over the nominated rate of 18 , 000 / d ( gas control will
confirm this ) .
since sat - sun - mon are all one gas day from a gas daily perspective , i told
gas control to try to balance on sun after the meter was fixed , by cutting
back to a lower flow rate .
so we will need to do a special allocation for the three days october 21 -
23 , saturday through monday . the three day total for the meter is 59 , 067
mmbtu . beaumont methanol nominated 54 , 000 mmbtu ( i . e . 18 , 000 / d for 3
days ) . we should allocate a total of 54 , 000 mmbtu to beaumont methanol for
the three days , and the 5 , 067 mmbtu excess will be purchased by brandywine -
under sitara # 484934 priced at gas daily hsc midpoint .

really is energy in / energy out . we should not be impacted in any way by a
reallocation to correct pvr percentages or a c 5 correction at the plant .
hpl / ena should rereceive the same volume , dth for dth at the residue or at a
redelivery point such as lobo / agua . i have left a message for my counterpart
at duke and am requesting that they deliver to us , somewhere , an additional
20 , 125 dth / day for the month of december to balance us out .
please let me know if you have any questions or comments . i will advise
everyone upon their agreement to payback so that our respective positions
reflect the additional supply .

subject : press release from kyle field
college station , tx ( ap ) - r . c . slocum and the texas a & m aggies are
demanding a recount of the game in which oklahoma won 35 to 31 . " the end
zones were confusing , " says slocum . " i ' m sure that some of the touchdowns
that went in oklahoma ' s end zone were meant to go into ours . we were
scoring in those end zones also . oklahoma would never have scored
thirty - five points . there ' s no way we lost this one . a & m demands a
recount . "
oklahoma officials are calling this " outrageous " . " they agreed to the size ,
shape and locations of the end zones prior to kick - off , " replies ou coach
bob stoops . " if they had a problem with them , they should have said so
before we started . you don ' t get to keep playing until you ' re happy with
the outcome . someone had to lose . we ' ve scored over thirty - five points
many times . "
a & m has sent lawyers , farmers , and those guys in the funny boots as well as
that damn dog down to kyle field , where the scoreboard will be tested . " we
are confident that when the points are re - totaled , we will be the winner of
the game , " says slocum .
ou also points out that in many games prior to this one , the same end zones
were used . " they didn ' t have a problem with the end zones until they lost , "
says stoops .
outside of kyle field , a & m student protesters have gathered outside bearing
signs such as , " a & m wants a fair game ! whoooooop ! " students ' thoughts
echoed their signs . " all we want is a fair total of the points before we
declare a winner , " says student karen hays , an aggie from marfa . " we need
to proceed cautiously and not rush to judgment before we declare a winner . "
abc , around 2 : 00 pm central time , had mistakenly declared a & m the winner ,
despite the slim 3 point lead the aggies held at that point . at about 2 : 30
pm , with the game still too close to call , abc had to back off its
prediction .
college football analyst brent musburger made the call . " we felt that with
a number of points still not added in by jamaar tombs and the aggies , we
were certain a & m would carry this game . we may have been premature in our
prediction . "

worked . if you have questions or would like to discuss , please let me know .
every instance i ' ve found looks okay because of the following :

* the deal was killed
* the deal was entered as a mistake buy and should of been a sell hence the
inactive state in unify
* the deal was a demand based deal price with no volumes

subject : re : sitara positions , end of month feedback from unify
please take note of dave ' s very important message regarding sitara
positions . we absolutely cannot afford to go through this again and need to
do everything possible to help limit the exposure . with prices where they
are and winter weather upon us we will most likely have a very challenging
bid week .
that being said i want each of you to make sure we adhere to the " daily
clean " process . you should pull all the necessary reports each day and keep
after the schedulers to make sure they are up to date . if you wish , donna and
richard can make these available each day and distribute to the group . we
don ' t have much time so this needs to happen immediately .
donna , please provide me with a daily summary of all the desks for the
remainder of the month .
let me know if you have any questions or concerns , thanks - bob

subject : sitara positions , end of month feedback from unify
bob , et al ,
as i am sure you recall , we had a problem with sitara positions earlier in
the month and had to cease trading early and revert to cpr for positions .
although i have not gotten very far in my transition off of unify and onto
sitara and tds , we do see some potential for this happening again towards the
end of this month and the beginning of next month .
the problem with managing positions is a combination of sheer deal counts ,
along with updates to those deals . a large portion of these updates come to
sitara via the unify bridge back process . it would be ideal if we could
continue to have the unify data " cleaned / scrubbed " week to week and try to
avoid having the bulk of the month being updated / bridged in the final
week / days of the month . i know this is the goal of logistics , but i just
want to help reinforce that goal due to the performance impact it can have on
the gas trading systems . perhaps a few extra pair of eyes on the pipeline
exception summary and the bridge back pipeline summary in unify this month
would help .
another area that causes these transaction counts to increase is the need to
have 2 months " active " at a time . in other words , when november is over and
we are in the first week or two of december , sitara continues to maintain
positions for november . this november data degrades the ability to update
december positions in a timely manner . we may find ourselves having to
remove the november deals from the sitara positions sooner than we have in
the past .
i will be trying to work with the sitara team in the coming days / weeks to
implement some combination of quick fixes , as well as look into the long term
changes necessary to support our increased trading business .
please let me know if you have any questions or comments in this area .

this is a follow up to the conversation you had with pat yesterday and to
reiterate retro contract assignments . we have decided to go back to the old
process of handling contract assignments mid - month . this means that if we
receive an assignment from legal after the 10 th workday , that assignment will
become effective for current month the following month . for example , if i
receive a notice from whomever that xyz has been assigned to abc on 11 / 15 / 00
for an legal effective date of 4 / 00 , i will create a new deal from 4 / 00
forward . on the new deal the currect month will be zeroed out under the
expected volumes . bob would not start nominating this new deal until 12 / 00 ,
leaving 4 / 00 - 11 / 00 to be moved by volume mangement .
if this is not a clear understanding from all parties , please let me know .
rita : if this becomes burdensome on your group , please let me know and we
will readdress this issue .

anita ,
after speaking with gary lamphier , big thicket ' s allocation for
pecos ' / roberson ' s portion will be done differently . historically , their
portion of the allocation was reduced for shrinkage . effective with october
00 ' s allocation , shrink will no longer be deducted . the full amount of
pecos / roberson ' s gas received at meter 6753 and delivered out at meter 8714
( vastar ) will be kept whole . i spoke with your contact harold mcgee at big
thicket and he spoke with pecos / roberson regarding this and everyone is
agreement . your allocation process will be done the same , however the
pecos / roberson number on the allocation statement will no longer have
shrinkage deducted . i have gone over the numbers for october with harold and
he has stated the 23 , 174 is the amount that will be allocated to
pecos / roberson , 946 will go to jay , and 9114 will be for enron ( this portion
has always been kept whole ) . can you please make sure that this is done . if

marySubject: implementation of the gas message board application
please see the following instructions for the new messenging board . if you
have any trouble entering into this site , please let me know . everyone
should now be setup and ready to go . you will have to add this site to one of
your favorites .
the gas message board application can run on both ie 5 . 0 and ie 5 . 5 now .
attached is the url for user to run the application .
http : / / gasmsgboard . dev . corp . enron . com
please feel free to forward above url to people who like to test the
application .
here is the steps they should do :
1 ) launch internet explorer
2 ) type : http : / / gasmsgboard . dev . corp . enron . com ( or just open this email and
click on above url )
3 ) users should see the messages if there is any new messages for today . if
they don ' t see any messages , there are two reasons :
( 1 ) they are not valid users . their names have not been added into the nt
web _ gastraders group yet . please contact chrysti hardy to add their names
into the group .
( 2 ) there is no new messages added yet .
4 ) click on " comments " button to add messages : there will be a popup window
when user clicks on " comments " button . there are two ways to send the
messages after typing the
messages into the text box :
( 1 ) just simply press enter to send the message . or
( 2 ) click on " send " button to send the message .
5 ) after the message has been sent , the message will be displayed on the main
window immediately , the rest people who are online will get the new message
in less than 30 seconds . this time can be reduced to as less as 1 second .
however , i would not recommend to reduce the time interval less than 10
second . because each time the browser refreshes the screen , the screen will
be blink . users don ' t want the screen blink every second while they read the
messages .
6 ) all messages will be cleaned up daily at 6 : 00 pm . if they like to clean
them up later than 6 : 00 pm , please let me know . i can reset the time .
note : right now the application is under test environment . if they like it , i
will move it into production environment soon .
let me know any feedbacks .

gerald / eric -
i have a couple of questions regarding tglo transport contract
012 - 88494 - 202 . we are currently delivering a volume of 28 . 000 mm into various
midcon interconnects on this contract that are designated to go to
reliant / entex for the purpose of heating hisd schools . the transport
contract stipulates different rates for this delivery depending on whether
the gas is intended for state facilities or not . my first question , then ,
is : are hisd schools considered state facilities ? and , if hisd schools are
considered state facilities , does the fact that this gas is being delivered
to them via reliant / entex utilizing midcon ' s pipe make any difference ?
i am asking these questions not only to assure that we are recouping the
correct transport rate , but also to determine what the consequences might be
if i interrupt this delivery . we are having difficulty getting enough gas
into midcon to cover our entex noms and i am just exploring my options . i
would also expect that this volume should decrease when hisd closes for the
christmas holidays - does the fact that this is an it agreement give me enough
leverage to cut this nom if tglo does not do so voluntarily ?

i am working on clearing an old txu lone star / gas distribution balance from
8 / 99 and 9 / 99 . we originally billed txu on nominated quantities and they
have shortpaid us due to meter adjustments . these are brokered deals where
we sold to txu and purchased from exxonmobil and highland . txu has provided
meter support since the deals were on lone star pipeline , however , i am
unsure how to have volume management reallocate .
for example , we originally sold 10 , 000 mmbtu on 8 / 3 / 99 to txu and purchased
1 , 200 mmbtu from highland energy and 8 , 800 mmbtu from exxonmobil . txu shows
the total amount of gas on 8 / 3 / 99 was 9 , 240 mmbtu . how should the purchase
piece be allocated between exxonmobil and highland since this was a brokered
deal ?

booked to the cleburne desk . we actually owe $ 1 , 798 , 389 . 73 , but i need to

christy ,
per our conversation i have attached below the updated version of the
reallocation difference . texas general land received 21 . 8945 % of the total
volume which was 55 , 645 mmbtu . after updating the spreadsheet spinnaker will
owe hpl approximately $ 36 , 000 .
thanks ,

gary ,
when spinnaker got paid , the volumes inadvertently got averaged over the
month . since spinnaker was paid gas
daily pricing for the month , there is going to be a dollar discrepancy when
the volumes are re - sent over on the actual
day of flow . in my calculations ( using gas daily less $ . 21 as the price ) we
are going to owe spinnaker an additional
$ 220 , 398 . 57 .
one issue that needs to be addressed is this : should the additional money go
directly to spinnaker since they are allocating
out october 2000 production payments to ranger and houston exploration ?
attached is a spreadsheet showing where i came up with the extra money owed :
thank you all ! !

ps this does not address the issue between the onshore and offshore meter ,
this is just addressing the redistribution
of volumes for the month of october .Subject: tenaska iv 10 / 00
we have actuals . the larger of the two volumes is 1 , 395 , 000 , which is
45 , 000 / day , so the demand rate in deal 514353 is fine . i am having a
problem , though , with the way it is coming to settlements . it is showing up
with a jan 2003 delivery date . i think the demand fee needs to be on 10 / 1
only . right now , it is on a line with a date of 10 / 1 / 00 to 12 / 31 / 36 . i
think this is confusing the system some how . also , we still need the
purchase deal for tenaska iv . it should be for a demand fee of $ 2 , 571 , 135 . 73
booked to the cleburne desk . we actually owe $ 1 , 798 , 389 . 73 , but i need to
net the tenaska iv sales with the purchase to clear those receivables . james
is calling me every day asking for an update . do you know when we will be
able to get this in the system ? i have attached my spreadsheet so you can
see the numbers .

some allocations resolved for several different months . transco told us they
would not go back and reallocate due to the statute of limitations ( 6
months ) . february had a significant amount not allocated . we just need a

45 , 000 / day , so the demand rate in deal 514353 is fine . i am having a
problem , though , with the way it is coming to settlements . it is showing up
with a jan 2003 delivery date . i think the demand fee needs to be on 10 / 1
only . right now , it is on a line with a date of 10 / 1 / 00 to 12 / 31 / 36 . i
think this is confusing the system some how . also , we still need the
purchase deal for tenaska iv . it should be for a demand fee of $ 2 , 571 , 135 . 73
booked to the cleburne desk . we actually owe $ 1 , 798 , 389 . 73 , but i need to
net the tenaska iv sales with the purchase to clear those receivables . james
is calling me every day asking for an update . do you know when we will be
able to get this in the system ? i have attached my spreadsheet so you can
see the numbers .

the numbers for october between ena - tetco and hpl vary a good bit . are we

victor ,
the sitara ticket that we were using for the month of october is # 421415 .
tetco shows that the volumes that hpl was allocated on october 6 th and
october 19 th , were 9 dths and 44 dths , respectively . those volumes were
pulled off of our backhaul contract because there was no nomination in
place . this is the same problem that we have had over and over with them .
also , we just found out on tuesday , that the oba did not go into effect until
december 1 , 2000 . we were originally told that they were putting the oba in
effect retroactively to november of 1999 . in fact , i thought that hpl had
made a lot of retroactive changes in the system to adjust for the oba , do you
remember that ? hpl told us that ray calles at tetco is the one who decided
that the oba would not be effective until december of 2000 . nobody even
informed us of this change , i stumbled upon it when researching a november
issue for alfonso trabulsi and brenda fletcher . in addition to all of this ,
i received another email , which i will copy below , asking me to go in for the
month of october and adjust all of my estimated volumes in unify to match
what hpl shows that we were allocated . i had been going in all month long
and matching to their numbers , and we were clean for the deadline at the end
of the month . i ran the allocation report from tetco for the month of
october , and some of hpl ' s numbers were very different from tetco ' s ,
including the two days that i mentioned above . i sent jackie young an email
back showing her tetco ' s numbers and i haven ' t received a response . i will
copy that email below as well , just to catch you up on what ' s been going on .

subject : october volumes
hi jackie ,
i ran a report from tetco ' s system to show the volumes that enron was
allocated for the month of october , and some of the volumes are very
different from the volumes that you show . i copied your numbers below and
copied tetco ' s volumes below that ( with the disrepancies in red ) . i was
wondering if you could double check the 3 rd , 4 th , 11 th , 12 th , 25 th , and 27 th
to see if you had purchases on those days from a counterparty other than
enron north america at that meter . it looks like maybe the volumes that you
show are the total flow at that meter , but i think that only part of the gas
was actually allocated to us . i don ' t mind putting the allocated volumes in
path manager , but i ' d like to make sure that on the above days , i am only
putting in the amount that enron was allocated .
also , on the 6 th and the 19 th tetco shows exactly half of what you show ,
which i thought was kind of strange . i am going to have to get tetco ' s
permission to do a retroactive nomination for those two days at the volumes
you have requested , before i can put anything in sitara or unify . my manager
is out of the office and will be back tomorrow , but i would like for him to
double check the deal that we will have to create in sitara for those two
days , since we are dealing with a prior month issue .

in most cases , ena will be a net buyer from tenaska iv for activity related
to the cleburne plant . however , for october 2000 , the plant was down the
majority of the month and ena sold off the supply , resulting in ena owing
money to tenaska iv .
i have created deal 529856 with a demand of $ 1 , 798 , 389 . 73 , which is the
calculated amount of income on the cleburne desk . ( please see the attached
schedule . ) we need to pass this income on to tenaska iv . do we need to pay
this amount ( wire from ena to tenaska iv ) or is there another way to do

we have actuals . the larger of the two volumes is 1 , 395 , 000 , which is
45 , 000 / day , so the demand rate in deal 514353 is fine . i am having a
problem , though , with the way it is coming to settlements . it is showing up
with a jan 2003 delivery date . i think the demand fee needs to be on 10 / 1
only . right now , it is on a line with a date of 10 / 1 / 00 to 12 / 31 / 36 . i
think this is confusing the system some how . also , we still need the
purchase deal for tenaska iv . it should be for a demand fee of $ 2 , 571 , 135 . 73
booked to the cleburne desk . we actually owe $ 1 , 798 , 389 . 73 , but i need to
net the tenaska iv sales with the purchase to clear those receivables . james
is calling me every day asking for an update . do you know when we will be
able to get this in the system ? i have attached my spreadsheet so you can
see the numbers .
meganSubject: re : tenaska iv 10 / 00
darren ,
the demand fee is probably the best solution . we can use it to create a
recieivable / payable with tenaska , depending on which way the calculation goes
each month . how are pma ' s to be handled once the fee been calculated and the
deal put in the system ?
attatched is a schedule detailing what is on the gl for cleburne as of
today . some of this info will change by the end of the month . as you can
see , there are some discrepancies between megan ' s calculations and what is on
the general ledger . ua 4 is also on my schedule . unless the buys / sells are
volumetrically balanced , we book an entry to balance the desk . this will
change the calculation of what is due from / to tenaska . should we be
recording a ua 4 entry for cleburne ? is it addressed in the agreement with
tenaska ?

in most cases , ena will be a net buyer from tenaska iv for activity related
to the cleburne plant . however , for october 2000 , the plant was down the
majority of the month and ena sold off the supply , resulting in ena owing
money to tenaska iv .
i have created deal 529856 with a demand of $ 1 , 798 , 389 . 73 , which is the
calculated amount of income on the cleburne desk . ( please see the attached
schedule . ) we need to pass this income on to tenaska iv . do we need to pay
this amount ( wire from ena to tenaska iv ) or is there another way to do
this ? this is the case for october 2000 and could possibly happen again in
the future .

you did not allocate this according to ray ' s schedule . the track id i gave
you was only for the purchase from ena . you need to extend the deal for the
purchase from dynegy . you put all of the volume on these 2 days on ena ,
that is not what is on ray ' s schedule , so we are still out on the

i think we need to remove some of the demand charges that have been set up
for williams and apache . on williams deal 384237 , the demand charge needs to
be removed from sept . 2000 . the demand charge should not have started until
october 2000 . because we did not know at the time what was happening with
this deal , the demand fee was inadvertently paid to williams for sept . and we
need to recoup our money . on apache deal 384247 , james thinks we need to
remove the demand charge completely . he says it is not a part of the deal
and apache is not billing us for it . we also need to talk about the pricing
on both of these deals . williams and apache are billing us less than what we
have in sitara . to be able to keep this desk at zero , jim pond does not want
me to use pay the lesser of for the purchases , so we need to address the
price differences . you said you had some contract briefs that supported our
prices . please fax a copy to me at 713 - 646 - 8420 and i will compare them to
what james has .
just a heads up . . . we are beginning to work on november 2000 , so we will need

meganSubject: tenaska iv gas
daren , per review of the gas agreements between tenaska iv and
williams / apache and our understanding of the agency agreement , i had a few
items i wanted to discuss with you ( in lieu of our meeting today that was
cancelled ) :
1 . looking at the october gas supply to the plant , i think tenaska iv should
have been charged at the contract prices with williams & apache ( i . e . 2 . 285 )
and not at what the final price that was actualized per megan ' s summary -
230 , 406 at $ 710 , 616 . 70 , price of $ 3 . 084 . if this volume was charged at
2 . 285 the total would have been $ 526 , 477 . 71 , a difference of $ 184 , 138 . 99 .
2 . looking at the november gas supply to the plant , tenaska iv was charged
$ 2 . 91 per mmbtu , instead of $ 2 . 285 for volumes of 267 , 300 . at the $ 2 . 91
price , the total settlement price was $ 777 , 843 instead of $ 610 , 780 . 50 at
2 . 285 , showing a difference of $ 167 , 062 . 50 .
i reviewed the gas supply agreements and the williams gas price ( pg . 19 ) for
2000 gas is 2 . 32 , which can be adjusted by the waha transportation adjustment
if delivered at waha . this adjustment started in 1997 at $ . 03 per mmbtu and
increase by 5 % per year . thereby currently , the adjustment factor is at
. 0347 , giving us a price of $ 2 . 2853 per mmbtu .
in reviewing the apache gas agreement ( pg . 22 ) , i noticed that the gas price
is 2 . 285 at waha & 2 . 315 at katy / carthage for 2000 . per review of the apache
invoices , it appears that we are not getting our gas at these points but at
other places ( i . e . lomak - sterling & mendell cdp ) at a price of $ 2 . 175 . if
enron has a separate agreement at these delivery points and can capture a
margin difference then that is upside to enron . however , i think the plant
should not be charged above the contract price of $ 2 . 285 .
looking at the daily gas that was scheduled to the plant for november and
october , i did not see that their use went over the contracted volumes from
williams and apache of 45 , 000 mmbtu per day . therefore i don ' t think spot
prices are part of the equation here . additionally , i recall from our
meeting last month that all enron makes on this deal is the agency fee of
$ . 04 per mmbtu ( excluding the margin difference that enron has on apache gas
delivery points if my scenario above is correct ) .
so based upon items 1 & 2 above , i am suggesting that tenaska iv adjust their
november invoice owed to enron for gas used by the plant by the gas price
differences showed above . therefore , i am planning to wire a payment of
$ 484 , 234 . 03 ( see breakout below ) on friday , 12 / 22 , to enron on behalf of
tenaska iv texas partners , ltd . for this activity .
month plant gas price amount
november 267 , 300 2 . 91 $ 777 , 843
november adjustment $ ( 167 , 062 . 50 )
october adjustment $ ( 184 , 138 . 99 )
nov . agency fee 1 , 350 , 000 . 04 $ 54 , 000
sept . agency fee 98 , 813 . 04 $ 3 , 592 . 52
total $ 484 , 234 . 03
i discussed these issues with mike mazowita , rick hill & jody pierce before
reaching this conclusion . should you have any different ideas or thoughts
that i am not covering , please call me at 3 - 7280 and we can discuss . thanks .

lauri , from a legal standpoint , we can cut the nomination on an
interruptible agreement at our discretion . the contract clearly gives us
this right . i haven ' t specifically reviewed the contract , but i am assuming
it is our standard form . i will check this .
yes , i would consider hisd facilities to be state facilities . the fact that
this goes to entex first complicates the issue .
dan , was the intent that it be directly delivered to state facilities , or if
it ultimately ended up at state facilities ?

gerald / eric -
i have a couple of questions regarding tglo transport contract
012 - 88494 - 202 . we are currently delivering a volume of 28 . 000 mm into various
midcon interconnects on this contract that are designated to go to
reliant / entex for the purpose of heating hisd schools . the transport
contract stipulates different rates for this delivery depending on whether
the gas is intended for state facilities or not . my first question , then ,
is : are hisd schools considered state facilities ? and , if hisd schools are
considered state facilities , does the fact that this gas is being delivered
to them via reliant / entex utilizing midcon ' s pipe make any difference ?
i am asking these questions not only to assure that we are recouping the
correct transport rate , but also to determine what the consequences might be
if i interrupt this delivery . we are having difficulty getting enough gas
into midcon to cover our entex noms and i am just exploring my options . i
would also expect that this volume should decrease when hisd closes for the
christmas holidays - does the fact that this is an it agreement give me enough
leverage to cut this nom if tglo does not do so voluntarily ?

i don ' t want to tell you to add any contracts , because i am not sure about
that . i am just saying if you look at ray ' s schedule there are 2 deals out
there , one is a purchase from ena and the other a purchase from dynegy . the
track id i gave you was for ena . you cannot allocate the dynegy piece
until i give you a track id . i cannot give you a track id until the deal is
extended for days 10 / 6 and 10 / 19 .

arre you saying that for both days that two ( 2 ) ena contracts should be
placed at the meter for days 6 and 19 and then allocating half of the the
total volume to each contract ?

jackie ,
you did not allocate this according to ray ' s schedule . the track id i gave
you was only for the purchase from ena . you need to extend the deal for the
purchase from dynegy . you put all of the volume on these 2 days on ena ,
that is not what is on ray ' s schedule , so we are still out on the
interconnect report .

jackie ,
your allocation is correct with the exception of days 10 / 6 and 10 / 19 where
strangers gas is allocated . i have created an accounting arrangement for
these days and the new track id for ena is 240384 . please allocate the ena
portion according to rays schedule for these 2 days . deal 422516 ( purchase
from dynegy ) needs to be extended for these 2 days so i can do an accounting
arrangement . alfonso i need for you to allocate your meter daily , because
we have tiered pricing this month .

on 1 / 25 / 2000 the above meter has recorded flow of 18 mmbtus into hpl ' s

approval to write - off the volumes to unaccounted for gas loss
the above meter was a new meter effective 1 / 1 / 2000 , and therefore , the volume
flowing into hpl was probably caused by putting the meter in service .

nick ,
i am not sure what happened to this volume . i cannot tell by the audit
trail , but there is a connection between meter hpl meter 987283 , and midt
989807 . the volume you are referring to is on mid - tex pipeline under meter
989807 . it it pathed as a point to point nom with no deal reference . i do
not think this is correct because the deal you reference show hplc as
purchaser . the volume is in mips under meter 989807 , but the supply deal
is set up on hpl meter 987283 , and the audit trail in sitara shows the deal
was moved from midt to hpl . get with thu when she returns to see if she

subject : tenaska iv gas
daren , per review of the gas agreements between tenaska iv and
williams / apache and our understanding of the agency agreement , i had a few
items i wanted to discuss with you ( in lieu of our meeting today that was
cancelled ) :
1 . looking at the october gas supply to the plant , i think tenaska iv should
have been charged at the contract prices with williams & apache ( i . e . 2 . 285 )
and not at what the final price that was actualized per megan ' s summary -
230 , 406 at $ 710 , 616 . 70 , price of $ 3 . 084 . if this volume was charged at
2 . 285 the total would have been $ 526 , 477 . 71 , a difference of $ 184 , 138 . 99 .
2 . looking at the november gas supply to the plant , tenaska iv was charged
$ 2 . 91 per mmbtu , instead of $ 2 . 285 for volumes of 267 , 300 . at the $ 2 . 91
price , the total settlement price was $ 777 , 843 instead of $ 610 , 780 . 50 at
2 . 285 , showing a difference of $ 167 , 062 . 50 .
i reviewed the gas supply agreements and the williams gas price ( pg . 19 ) for
2000 gas is 2 . 32 , which can be adjusted by the waha transportation adjustment
if delivered at waha . this adjustment started in 1997 at $ . 03 per mmbtu and
increase by 5 % per year . thereby currently , the adjustment factor is at
. 0347 , giving us a price of $ 2 . 2853 per mmbtu .
in reviewing the apache gas agreement ( pg . 22 ) , i noticed that the gas price
is 2 . 285 at waha & 2 . 315 at katy / carthage for 2000 . per review of the apache
invoices , it appears that we are not getting our gas at these points but at
other places ( i . e . lomak - sterling & mendell cdp ) at a price of $ 2 . 175 . if
enron has a separate agreement at these delivery points and can capture a
margin difference then that is upside to enron . however , i think the plant
should not be charged above the contract price of $ 2 . 285 .
looking at the daily gas that was scheduled to the plant for november and
october , i did not see that their use went over the contracted volumes from
williams and apache of 45 , 000 mmbtu per day . therefore i don ' t think spot
prices are part of the equation here . additionally , i recall from our
meeting last month that all enron makes on this deal is the agency fee of
$ . 04 per mmbtu ( excluding the margin difference that enron has on apache gas
delivery points if my scenario above is correct ) .
so based upon items 1 & 2 above , i am suggesting that tenaska iv adjust their
november invoice owed to enron for gas used by the plant by the gas price
differences showed above . therefore , i am planning to wire a payment of
$ 484 , 234 . 03 ( see breakout below ) on friday , 12 / 22 , to enron on behalf of
tenaska iv texas partners , ltd . for this activity .
month plant gas price amount
november 267 , 300 2 . 91 $ 777 , 843
november adjustment $ ( 167 , 062 . 50 )
october adjustment $ ( 184 , 138 . 99 )
nov . agency fee 1 , 350 , 000 . 04 $ 54 , 000
sept . agency fee 98 , 813 . 04 $ 3 , 592 . 52
total $ 484 , 234 . 03
i discussed these issues with mike mazowita , rick hill & jody pierce before
reaching this conclusion . should you have any different ideas or thoughts
that i am not covering , please call me at 3 - 7280 and we can discuss . thanks .

i took a look at the transport for txu lone star for tenaska iv for 10 / 00 .
we mostly have price differences , but one deal needs some days added . let me
know if you need copies of the invoices . the meters below are delivery
meters . i wasn ' t sure what the receipt meters would be .
deal 452491 , meter 20014903 need to add days 24 - 26 and 28 - 31
need to check rate - we show $ 0 . 01 and we were billed $ 0 . 02
deal 452491 , meter 25000200 need to check rate - we show $ 0 . 02 and we were
billed $ 0 . 10

meganSubject: tenaska iv 11 / 00
i am having trouble with the transport deal for the tenaska iv contracts on
lone star . we have deal 452491 in sitara for meter 20014804 at a $ 0 . 01
transport rate . we received the statement from txu lone star and it does not
agree with our deal . they are billing for meter 25000200 at $ 0 . 10 and meter
20014903 at $ 0 . 02 . these meters relate to the tenaska iv sale deal 384258
and the tenaska marketing deal 459898 , respectively . should our deal match
what txu is billing or is there another deal that i am missing ? i haven ' t
worked with transport very much , so i could be confused . i think we have
this problem with oct 2000 , also , but i have not reviewed it yet . i am going
to look at it this afternoon . tenaska iv has already reimbursed us for the
txu transport , so we will need to pay this next week .
also , now that we have the actuals for nov 2000 , we need to update the demand
fees to reflect the correct volumes . barring any changes , i have listed the
adjustments below and attached my spreadsheet . the unify adjustments will be
over by about $ 20 . 00 from the spreadsheet . i thought it would be better have
the cleburne desk at zero , than to leave a balance .
1 . deal 529856 - change 11 / 1 demand fee from $ 341 , 250 . 47 to $ 493 , 365 . 74
( difference $ 152 , 115 . 27 )
2 . deal 529856 - change 11 / 2 demand fee from $ 167 , 062 . 50 to $ 159 , 721 . 55
( difference $ 7 , 340 . 95 )
3 . deal 514353 - change agency fee volume from 45 , 000 / day to 45 , 016 / day

i want to thank you for your response time in getting cody a draft of the
amendment for them to look at this morning . cody will be out of their
current obligation for this gas on february 11 th , i will firm this date up
here
in the next couple of days . cody has requested that we strike the gas daily
price for gas brought on any day other than the lst day of the month . this
language is mentioned in article 2 . contract price . 2 . 1 price . i have called
darren farmer on the texas desk and explained my situation to him . he
passed on to me that this is not a problem since i will know the date and
volume this package will start flowing to hplc . please e - mail a copy after
these changes for approval to be sent overnight to cody . thanks !Subject: re : kcs buy / sell

subject : kcs buy / sell
in light of december ' s allocation of actual volumes at kcs # 9797 , it looks as
though we need to reduce the nom at both this meter and at tejas riverside ,
# 3543 , where the " sell " portion of this buy / sell occurs for the remainder of
january . december actual receipts at # 9797 were 15 , 889 mm or an average of
513 mm / day . the january nomination is 864 mm / day . i think it needs to be
reduced to approx 345 mm / day effective 1 / 11 or there may be a large diffence
between what we buy at the wellhead and what is delivered back to kcs at
tejas riverside . any info you could get from gas control or kcs about actual
flow current month would help nail this nomination down . thanks .Subject: saxet canales into king ranch - balancing issue
fyi -
we are having some " after - the - fact " balancing issues with king ranch . i just
spoke with carol regarding our net position with the plant , she has informed
me that the saxet canales production we are buying at the inlet has been
averaging approximately 3 , 850 dth / day for january , and has been producing at
or around that level since november . we don ' t have eyes at the meter ,
however , carol was brought online this past week , and i will be receiving
production information on a regular basis to balance redeliveries .
we have been scheduling 838 to 1 , 045 dth / day at the meter . we need to gross
up for jan in order to ensure that we capture our volumes correctly and do
not create additional balancing issues with the plant .
please let me know if you have any further questions , or need additional
information .

marySubject: sale of hpl
to all :
the proposed sale of hpl to american electric power ( aep ) has been signed and
the conditions for the acquisition should be completed within the coming
months . over the next few days , i will be forwarding more details about the
transition process . these details will outline the employment opportunities
and transfer process to aep . aep is eager to complete these arrangements ,
as the pipeline is only as valuable as the people who operate it .
during the transition period , it is important that we keep the pipe line
operating at our historical level of reliability in order to meet the energy
needs of our customers .

ext 31994Subject: texoma - beaumont hpl maintenance
this is in regard to the maintenance that you want to do at the texoma -
beaumont interconnect ( replace some valves , i believe ) .
we had discussed doing this at a time when mobil beaumont refinery would have
low gas takes . that window of opportunity will be in early to mid february .
mobil will take down some of the units at different times during the month .
some of these units are endothermic , some are exothermic , so in some cases
their gas load goes up when they take certain units down . but based on the
schedule of ups and downs that i ' ve been given , it looks like their gas load
will be at a low point between february 1 and february 12 , at somewhere
around 50 , 000 / d . last we talked about hpl continuing to deliver 20 , 000 / d
through the low pressure meter , and delivering the rest through centana . is
this still the plan ? ?
we met with mobil last year in july to talk to them about what we need to
do : that it would take less than a day , and that during that time , hpl would
deliver some of our gas to them through the centana meter . but that meeting
was a long time ago , and we might need to meet again - you know how
conservative
one thing of concern : in the past two months , we have effected some of our
midcon delivery obligation by delivering 30 , 000 / d gas in kind to mobil
beaumont . so we will not be able to do this during the day that we do our
maintenance .
once you gents let me know what you game plan is and confirm how we ' ll handle
gas flows while we do our work , i ' d like to be the one that initially tells
mobil of our plans and set up the initial meeting . it ' s going to take a lot
of coordination because i can guarantee you that mobil ' s maintenance schedule
will change !

please follow the instructions below .
why : a suggestion was made ( by carlos ) to centralize transport nominations
we receive by email . we now have an email account set up :
hpl . scheduling @ enron . com . the group is to let our customers know this is
where all nominations need to be sent . this way , if people are out ( or no
longer with us ) , someone will be able to receive the nomination change . i
have also created folders for each shipper . as each nomination is addressed ,
the file is to be moved to the folder for later reference . if the file is
still in the " inbox " , it has not been addressed .
any comments to this , i would greatly appreaciate feedback .

there is a new version of stack manager which is being released this evening ,
for use on monday morning .
changes
1 ) " inactivate suspended children " - new menu item available by
right - clicking on a parent product . it will change all child products of the
highlighted parent from " suspended " to " inactive " . note that this will be
applied only to the product which you highlight . it will also show available
when highlighting products which are not parents , but it will have no effect .
2 ) the transaction list has been amended to correctly display only those
transactions completed on the calendar day ( problem has affected australia
and singapore ) .
3 ) a constant spread which is changed from the front page of the stack
manager will stay as changed for that product . the spread will persist even
if transactions occur .
background
suspended child products continue to have their prices updated as the price
of the parent changes . inactive child products do not have their prices
updated . the price update process slows down enrononline processing and stack
manager response , so it is advantageous to ensure all non - active products are
in an inactive state .
if you have any questions on the above , please contact the enrononline call

employee can be obtained via the performance management system ( pep ) .
to download the evaluation forms from pep , please follow the steps below :

your employees that should receive year end evaluations are listed below :
bellamy , elizabeth
neuweiler , stacey kSubject: ranks communication
after getting your imput , i think this is the best :
we will only communicate needs improvement and issues . there will be
differing messages for needs improvement which fit the situation - some need
to hear that they are not performing at a high enought level relative to
peers to help us achieve business goals or for them to be considered for a
bonus ( may need to finda another role within or outside enron which is a
better fit ) . message to someone new to enron in that category should be
different . glad they are here : believe that as they learn the organization
and their job that they will be able to make significant contribution : doing
the right thing to learn business , but that contributions to date are not
significant enough to warrant payment of a bonus .
let me know what you think .
thanks

friday 1 / 19 / 01 - received a call from sheila at basin regarding a well which
may be coming on this weekend ( meter 9696 ) . phone lee in gas control
regarding same . lee informed me that hpl would prefer that the volumes are
not brought on until a field tech can pull a sample and verify that there are
no liquids involved . lee further informed me that the same day to tejas at
hardy was not in the system , and , per gary hanks , needed to be corrected .
lee informed me that the volumes were actually split 10 m at hardy / tejas and
10 m at lomax . i went into sitara and updated the deal ticket , pathed and
nominated over to pops .
saturday 1 / 20 / 01 - 8 : 30 am sean paged regarding the nomination at dow
freeport , he was questioning the validity , as we do not often flow at this
meter . i checked and the nomination was good for saturday ' s gas day . sean
informed me that the valero refinery was up and down and would be going
completely down on sunday .
10 : 00 am - sean called regarding tejas laporte , meter 665 . apparently , the
meter had a confirmed volume of 20 m and hpl / ena had no deal at the meter .
checked in pops and discovered that the deal was confirmed at 20 m on a deal
volume of zero . informed sean that the tejas volume was confirmed . also ,
per sean koch george west ( meter 6722 ) had a nomination increase of 10 m ,
which he wanted to confirm .
sunday 1 / 21 / 01 10 : 00 am sean paged regarding the dow meter 1442 , pops still
showed a confirmed voume of 10 m which dow and oasis showed at zero for
sunday . i checked the system and confirmed that the meter was indeed at
zero and phoned sean back to confirm . checked on mtp hardy , sean informed me
that we came in on rate for saturday and that current meter activity looked
good .Subject: meter 8022 - bad scada feedback to sitara

daveSubject: texoma - beaumont interconnect
mobil says the low point of their takes will be during february will be from
feb 1 to 14 . so any day in that time period would be a good time for hpl to
do the required maintenance at the texoma - beaumont system interconnect .
we need to define our game plan :
- what day to do the work
- how much gas hpl will deliver through our own meter
- how we use centana to deliver the rest of the hpl volumes
- if we had planned in feb to baseload some of our midcon obligation at mobil
as we have done in dec and jan , then we will need to do something different
whenever we do the maintenance
james - we are scheduled to meet with mobil in beaumont at 10 . 30 am thursday
feb 1 , to go over the game plan with them .
pat - do you want anyone from hms to attend ?
thanks

i have reviewed the gas composition analysis from spl of the basin production
from ga 213 . while spl ' s analysis does show a dewpoint of around 20 degrees
f at 400 psig , it is both my and john handley ' s opinion that the gas from the
wellbore had stratified by the time that this sample was taken . we expect
the dewpoint of the flowing gas to be higher . however , this was the best
sample that could be obtained at the time . we have conferred with steve
schneider and we are willing to take this gas on a conditional basis over the
next couple of days . once the 6 " line has been pigged , the production flows
stablilized and mitchell ' s conditioning equipment lined out over the next
couple of days , hms will need to take another sample at the meter run and
have spl run an extended analysis with a dewpoint curve on an expedited
basis . should this sample indicate a dewpoint over 45 degrees f , then this
production will be shut in again until hydrocarbon dewpoint conditioning
equipment has been installed . in the meantime , hms needs to keep a close

i have reviewed the gas composition analysis from spl of the basin production
from ga 213 . while spl ' s analysis does show a dewpoint of around 20 degrees
f at 400 psig , it is both my and john handley ' s opinion that the gas from the
wellbore had stratified by the time that this sample was taken . we expect
the dewpoint of the flowing gas to be higher . however , this was the best
sample that could be obtained at the time . we have conferred with steve
schneider and we are willing to take this gas on a conditional basis over the
next couple of days . once the 6 " line has been pigged , the production flows
stablilized and mitchell ' s conditioning equipment lined out over the next
couple of days , hms will need to take another sample at the meter run and
have spl run an extended analysis with a dewpoint curve on an expedited
basis . should this sample indicate a dewpoint over 45 degrees f , then this
production will be shut in again until hydrocarbon dewpoint conditioning
equipment has been installed . in the meantime , hms needs to keep a close
watch on all southern union city gates on galveston island to monitor for
liquids fallout .Subject: 2000 w 2 information

donald ,
back in october we had the gas received by hpl at the above meter moved to
strangers gas pending a call from coastal to renegotiate a contract for sept
2000 gas . since volumes can no longer be allocated to stranger  , s gas it has
been placed on an mjg deal which was the only valid deal available for sept
2000 .
i assume coastal has not contacted brian as of yet . is it possible to have a
deal created for coastal with a price of zero ? i know that we definitely do
not want to pay mjg for this gas , but as long as the volume is sitting on
their deal there is a possibility that someone may inadvertently send the
payment out . let me know what you think .

contacting coastal to negotiate any type of deal affecting the gas received
in september at at meter 4179 . it was brian ' s opinion that the gas should be
considered strangers gas since hpl has no contract or price . it is
suggested that nick moshou contact his counterpart at coastal , relaying this
information and suggesting coastal ' s trader contract brian riley .

nick ,
i understand that they terminated their agreement . however , i don ' t feel
that we can confiscate their production . we need to either pay them for the
gas , or cut a deal to redeliver a like volume to them at another meter .
given the decrease in prices from september to current and prompt month , i
would guess that they want to be paid . we won ' t know that until we call
them . i don ' t know where the responsibility lies as far as calling to
explain to them that we took delivery of their gas until the meter was
shut - in .
please let me know if i can do anything further to assist .

sorry it took me so long to get back to you . pg & e did not fully process the
gas stream at their indian springs plant on december 12 and 13 and took the
reduced shrinkage , 19 . 000 mmbtu / d , and sold it to hpl at gas daily - $ 0 . 04 .
pg & e did not have the right to do that , so they are going to allocate that
volume to comstock , from whom we will buy the gas at the beginng of the month
index . at the same time pg & e will create an imbalance , for which they will
pay hpl the same amount hpl paid them for the gas for those two days . this
should wash the sale at gas daily and leave hpl buying the gas at the
beginning of the month ifhsc ( the price in the comstock purchase contract )
and selling it at the gas daily price for 12 / 12 and 12 / 13 . the paperwork is
on its way to me to close this issue out .

ed ,
sherlyn has brought to my attention the deal i have attached below .
apparently we bot from pge industrial on the 12 th and 13 th . pg & e has
allocated an offsetting sale at the meter to teco , and claim that they are
net deals . i do not show a sale in the system at the meter , and i checked
the 215 k for those days for a corresponding delivery to teco , perhaps at
another meter , and could not find one .
any light you could shed on this issue would be appreciated .

subject : basin production from ga 213
i have reviewed the gas composition analysis from spl of the basin production
from ga 213 . while spl ' s analysis does show a dewpoint of around 20 degrees
f at 400 psig , it is both my and john handley ' s opinion that the gas from the
wellbore had stratified by the time that this sample was taken . we expect
the dewpoint of the flowing gas to be higher . however , this was the best
sample that could be obtained at the time . we have conferred with steve
schneider and we are willing to take this gas on a conditional basis over the
next couple of days . once the 6 " line has been pigged , the production flows
stablilized and mitchell ' s conditioning equipment lined out over the next
couple of days , hms will need to take another sample at the meter run and
have spl run an extended analysis with a dewpoint curve on an expedited
basis . should this sample indicate a dewpoint over 45 degrees f , then this
production will be shut in again until hydrocarbon dewpoint conditioning
equipment has been installed . in the meantime , hms needs to keep a close
watch on all southern union city gates on galveston island to monitor for
liquids fallout .Subject: re : january spot purchases - deals needed

subject : basin production from ga 213
i have reviewed the gas composition analysis from spl of the basin production
from ga 213 . while spl ' s analysis does show a dewpoint of around 20 degrees
f at 400 psig , it is both my and john handley ' s opinion that the gas from the
wellbore had stratified by the time that this sample was taken . we expect
the dewpoint of the flowing gas to be higher . however , this was the best
sample that could be obtained at the time . we have conferred with steve
schneider and we are willing to take this gas on a conditional basis over the
next couple of days . once the 6 " line has been pigged , the production flows
stablilized and mitchell ' s conditioning equipment lined out over the next
couple of days , hms will need to take another sample at the meter run and
have spl run an extended analysis with a dewpoint curve on an expedited
basis . should this sample indicate a dewpoint over 45 degrees f , then this
production will be shut in again until hydrocarbon dewpoint conditioning
equipment has been installed . in the meantime , hms needs to keep a close
watch on all southern union city gates on galveston island to monitor for
liquids fallout .Subject: re : first delivery - helmerich & payne

daren - - - on the 12 th , there is a sale to aquila on the header system , for
10 , 000 . . . . . . . . i think we were supplying it with aec . for whatever reason , i
had the aec 10 . 0 @ # 11230 into midcon . . . which isnt right because there was no
market for it , and midcon wasnt looking for it , but the aquila deal was at
# 700 on wgr ( aquila ) . so i went ahead and changed the aec ticket to match up
with the aquila deal . let me know if you think it is incorrect .

subject : eol deal ids in path manager
as you ' re aware , we ' re having to bridge houston street ids into unify from
sitara .
we are being asked , as a requirement , to not display the eol id on statements
that are identified as " broker eol trade " deals originating from eol . we
have two options to accomodate this requirement :
option 1 is to have the modify the bridge code to not bridge over the eol
deal id if the deal is a " broker eol trade " deal . one of the drawbacks of
this option is that you won ' t be able to referenence the eol id on the path
manager for these related deals . all other deals will have the eol deal id ,
if applicable . the eol id would not show up on the statements because it
wouldn ' t be populated .
option 2 is to modify several areas of code in the settlements area which may
be more time consuming . the obvious code change would be in the statement
generation area as well as other report type information .
option 2 allows you the greatest flexibility while option 1 may be quicker to
implement .
please pass this along to others in your group and get feedback . please
share your thoughts . . . .
i ' ve attached an email explaining the broker eol trades . this is not to be
confused with broker deals done at a given point with not transportation .
these will continue to come across as you ' d normally expect .
any questions , please ask . . .

discussion with duke , txu fuel co . does not have a transportation agreement
with
duke for the redelivery of this gas . the agreement is between enron and duke .
according to brian kerns of duke , they basically took assignment of the
existing
transportation agreement enron had with pg & e ( now el paso ) . if this is the
case , then we should be using the nominated amount as the driver towards
meeting
our monthly minimum purchase obligation . any imbalance between enron and duke
on the duke system receipts would be transparent to txu and worked out between
enron and duke . any imbalance between the nominated volumed and the actual
volumes received at the " teco tap " would need to be worked out between enron
and
txu fuel co . there are a couple of different ways to work this out , but i
need
to review the contract first . please look at this on your side and lets come
to
an agreement as soon as possible since the end of the month is quickly
approaching .

subject : contemporary poetry
guys ,
just thought you might find this interesting . ? i was forwarded this
poem , and told it was written by a high school student in az .
regardless , of who / where ( not the point ) i find it interesting , weirdly
amusing , and frighteningly fairly accurate . - pb
now i sit me down in school
where praying is against the rule
for this great nation under god
finds mention of him very odd .
if scripture now the class recites ,
it violates the bill of rights .
and anytime my head i bow
becomes a federal matter now .
our hair can be purple , orange or green ,
that ' s no offense , it ' s a freedom scene .
the law is specific , the law is precise .
prayers spoken aloud are a serious vice .
for praying in a public hall
might offend someone with no faith at all .
in silence alone we must meditate ,
god ' s name is prohibited by the state .
we ' re allowed to cuss and dress like freaks ,
and pierce our noses , tongues and cheeks .
they ' ve outlawed guns , but first the bible .
to quote the good book makes me liable .
we can elect a pregnant senior queen ,
and the ' unwed daddy , ' our senior king .
it ' s " inappropriate " to teach right from wrong ,
we ' re taught that such " judgments " do not belong .
we can get our condoms and birth controls ,
study witchcraft , vampires and totem poles .
but the ten commandments are not allowed ,
no word of god must reach this crowd .
it ' s scary here i must confess ,
when chaos reigns the school ' s a mess .
so , lord , this silent plea i make ,
should i be shot ; my soul please take !

per our recent discussions , please evaluate the above gas stream for
reconnection into hpl . this gas is presently being produced into dow
pipeline . an existing , three - inch meter tube is in place , and the gas can be
switched by opening and closing existing valves ? a copy of a recent gas
analysis has been provided . the expected gas flow is 9000 to 10 , 000 mcf / d .
mr . matt johnson with wagner hence , enhanced production . i would
attempt to obtain at least a year ' s commitment of this gas from wagner &
brown . mr . johnson did not want to flow this gas for march since the
three - inch run could not handle the total volume , and he did not want to
split the flow . operational logistics were also questionable ( compression ,
etc . ) . if you need further info , please advise . thanks . jabSubject: deals entered 3 / 01

daren :
sorry it has taken so long to get back to this issue , i am with ees now .
karen lindley allocates this point but i feel the need to help her because
this issue came to light while i was in transition .
exxon allocates this point and we receive a allocation statement from them on
a monthly basis .
december 2000
the total flow at the meter was 646 mmbtu . i copied esther garcia on this
e - mail so that she can look into the possibility that there is a measurement
error . esther will need to respond to karen on the matter of the possible
measurement error . furthermore it seems odd to me that scheduling had 8 , 928
mmbtu confirmed at this point and only 646 mmbtu flowed . i would ask mark
where he got his confirmed volumes from . as a temporary fix i reallocated
the meter and gave the total flow to alpine resources . they will be short
paid in their minds until ester and karen can get the possible measurement
error issue resolved . i would also suggest that mark and karen get together
to review the scheduling of this point so that karen can call exxon to
reconcile their allocation with what we have ( the additional alpine deal ) at
this point . charlene can redraft her invoice on monday 2 / 26 / 01 that will
show the 646 mmbtu going to alpine .
january 2001
again scheduling has 9 , 193 confirmed at this meter when on 3 , 241 mmbtu
flowed . i temporarily reallocated the meter so that the entire volume that
flowed went to alpine . they remain 10 mmbtu short paid but charlene can
redraft her invoice and pay them something until mark ( validity of other
deals at this point ) and karen ( exxon ' s allocation of this point ) can get
this issue resolved .
there is also the issue with the exxon transport at this point that was
scheduled at 1 , 500 mmbtu per month for the months in question . this
transport affects the allocation at the king ranch tailgate on the exxon 024
contract . i copied howard camp who will be training the contractor that will
take my place in volume management so that he can stay on top of the
resolution of this issue .

a deal to pay them . we should be getting jan . 2001 next week . is there a

saturday , march 3 , the redeliveries into hpl from fuels cotton valley for
the eastrans deal will increase to approximately 19500 mmbtu / dy . this
change should continue through march 5 th or 6 th . the reason for the change
is an operational emergency . defs typically delivers approximately 12200
mmbtu / dy into txu lone star . this delivery will not be able to occur
because the alford b compressor needs to get into the shop for maintenance .
this compressor will be out of commission for the month of march . the
busby compressor will compress the usual 7300 mmbtu / dy of fuels cotton
valley redelivery gas as well as the 12200 mmbtu / dy of txu lone star
redelivery gas . a different redelivery point with txu lone star is being
established and should be available by march 5 th or 6 th . at this point in
time , we will take the hpl fuels cotton valley redelivery gas to zero and
balance the redeliveries between the two points . therefore , defs will not
change the delivery or redelivery nominations in place for eastrans . after
the new txu lone star redelivery point is put into place and the points are
volume balanced , it is our intent to have redeliveries of 7300 mmbtu / dy
from fuels cotton valley and 22700 mmbtu / dy into pg & e ( which is what is in
place effective 3 / 1 / 01 ) for eastrans .Subject: neon for march 7

based on whatever they invoice us for , which typically has been a smaller

know of a good contact that we can call so that we receive the allocation on

california  , s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last several
months . unfortunately , this debate has generated more heat than light . we
want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis .
please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation
and our position on california energy issues .
what happened in california
the source of california  , s current problem is as straightforward as supply
and demand . california  , s economy grew 29 percent since 1998 . this increased
the demand for electricity by 24 percent . at the same time , regulatory
restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state . so
demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added . the result ,
predictably , is a shortage . this summer , peak capacity will be about 10
percent shy of peak demand , leading to further blackouts in the state .
in addition to the supply and demand imbalance , there are two other related
factors that led to the current crisis . first , the state  , s regulations
forced all sales and purchases into the spot market . the spot market for
power is extraordinarily volatile . the way firms behave in a free market
when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases long
term , medium term and short term , to reduce exposure to this volatility . in
california , state regulation prevented this strategy . this would be the
equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in the
most volatile interest rate environment imaginable . everything was fine
while the power surplus persisted , but when shortages ensued , every megawatt
was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price .
second , retail markets were not deregulated . regulated retail rates remained
in effect , and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep
competition out . this meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesale
prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the
regulated retail rate . they are now nearly bankrupt .
in short , california  , s problems were caused by regulation , not deregulation .
regulations prevented competitors from entering the market , prevented new
generation from being built , and prevented prudent hedging against volatile
spot prices .
at the time california was developing its restructuring plan , enron warned
the state  , s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives , which ,
if adopted , would have averted the current crisis .
enron  , s role
many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than fix
the problem . power sellers , including enron , have been vilified by the
politicians and the media . here are the facts :
? other than a small amount of wind power , enron is not a generator in the
state of california . every megawatt we sold in california we bought in the
same market available to other california purchasers . because we are a
market maker , not a generator , we are not biased toward high prices . we are
interested only in having a market that works so that we can package products
for our customers .
? as a seller to end - use markets in the state , we provided protection from
the problems the states  , utilities , and their customers , now face . we
protected , and still protect , our customers from price volatility .
you may have read that ees recently elected to have the utilities supply
power directly to its customers in california instead of procuring power on
the open market . early reports mischaracterized this as a  enron continues to sign up customers in the state ; and enron
continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in western
power markets . enron  , s primary business is managing risk for our customers
with solutions customized to meet their needs . there has never been more
demand for our products and services .
the solution
the solution to california  , s crisis is also straightforward . in summary , the
state must increase supply , reduce demand , reduce reliance on the spot market
and shore up the financial stability of the state  , s utilities .
increasing supply
california  , s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing
short of byzantine . enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in less
than a year . in california , it often takes 5 to 7 years . california simply
must streamline this process . ironically , while many of the regulations
generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality , the
regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and
displacing current plants , which emit 40 times as much nox . california can
have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new
facilities .
reducing demand
customers in california today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand .
they pay the same rate no matter what the market price is . an open retail
market would trigger demand responses , which would balance supply and demand
at lower prices than today . california should fully open its retail market .
reducing reliance on the spot market
in a truly deregulated market , customers would protect themselves from
volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer
term , fixed - price basis . the state has instead left procurement in the hands
of the utilities , which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market .
opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over their
price risk .
restoring the financial integrity of the state  , s institutions
the utilities in california are not paying their bills . this has led to
greater uncertainty in the market , higher costs , and reduced flexibility to
arrive at lasting solutions . california must permit its utilities to recover
their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and
distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is
needed .
just as important as doing these things , the state must avoid policies that ,
while politically attractive , do not fix the problem or even make matters
worse . price caps have been proposed . they don  , t work ; have never worked ;
and they will not work here . price caps succeed only in creating shortages ,
which then have to be allocated among competing users . imagine how
ineffectively the government would be in determining , for example , whether it
is better to make its limited power supplies available to the imperial valley
or silicon valley . price caps are a surefire way to make the current
shortage worse .
the state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in
california . there is no reason to believe , and every reason to doubt , that
the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in ,
constructing , operating and maintaining assets . this will also result in
california tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power
generation - - which the private sector can do - - instead of education , roads
and other public goods - - which the private sector cannot do .
as you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about the
crisis from the media , it  , s important for you to know this : we at enron will
continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real
solutions to the state .Subject: california energy crisis

? as a result of a variety of factors existing in the current california market , it made more sense for ees to source power for its customers directly from the utilities . this decision reduced ees ' s market price risk by allowing ees to access lower utility rates .
? ees did not terminate any customer contracts , and our customers continue to receive the financial benefits of their contract prices .
? ees is continuing to work with its california customers to provide them with other energy - related products and services , including assistance in reducing the demand for power , particularly at peak times .

dear christian friends ,
greetings in the name of our lord jesus !
we have two very urgent prayer requests . our dear friend and a brother , david gatewood , the son of late otis gatewood , has been recently diagnosed a pancreas cancer . david and his wife sandy were two of the first people who introduced dragica and me to christ and his church over thirty years ago . in 1969 they came to croatia ( yugoslavia at that time ) , as missionaries , with another couple , bud and beverly pickl . in order to get their resident visas , they enrolled in a croatian language study program . i was their professor at that time , and we became very good and close friends . david and sandy have been connected with the lord ? s work in croatia for all these years . before leaving croatia in 1972 , they adopted a little croatian girl , whom they raised with much love . she is a married woman now , and lives in colorado springs . david and sandy made several trips to croatia during the war , and david taught seminars on post - war traumatic experiences and the value of a family . your prayers will be greatly appreciated by many in croatia who love david dearly .
also , please , put me ( mladen ) on your prayer list . for several months now i ? ve been having some prostate problems . ten days ago my doctor requested a biopsy , and i am anxiously waiting to get the results this coming monday . dragica and i believe god listens and hears prayers of his people .
please , join the church in croatia with your prayers .
yours in his love and mercy ,

i have re - checked sitara & verified that the above deal was a term , firm
deal . this resulted in a gtc purchase firm contract being set - up in the
global contracts system . the term of the gtc was set as the term of the deal
( 4 / 1 / 00 thru 3 / 31 / 01 ) with no evergreen , meaning that the contract will
expire at the end of this month .
to the best of my knowledge , all gtc purchase firms have the same language &
they do not have evergreen . they expire at the end of the primary term .
so , unless exxon negotiated a deal with different , special language to allow
for evergreen & included something about a " 10 day notification " to
terminate , there isn ' t any reason to " terminate " this contract .
if this is the case , please advise . otherwise , i don ' t think we need to do
anything . the contract will expire at the end of this month on its own .

i guess you need to make sure that this is the same well that they nominated during bidweek . if it is , then we do need to change the price to gd . if it is a new well behind the meter , you can either create a new deal ticket for this piece , or create a pricing tier on the old ticket .

a volume of 6 , 289 mmbtu flowed over the noms for cp & l . i don ' t have a record of a spot deal with them for that day .
gary - currently , that volume has been allocated to the term agreement . the price difference on that day is significant . ( hsc gd mid was 5 . 245 ) . if you don ' t have a record of a spot deal , the allocation should stand as it is .

i do not have a record of a spot deal in my notes or my deal sheet . if bob
wants to call me with a tape that would be great . the . 085 difference
results in $ 405 so i will call bob and try to put this to bed . as of now

fee on deal 529856 in the amount of $ 1 , 143 , 484 . 53 . there is already a demand

we need to forward the money from the feb 2001 brazos sale to tenaska iv . i am assuming you want to handle this as before by entering a purchase demand fee on deal 529856 in the amount of $ 1 , 143 , 484 . 53 . there is already a demand fee for feb 2001 for $ 29 , 851 . 64 , so i think we just need to change that to the new amount . let me know if you want to handle this differently .

please respond to hi bubba !
lacy got her eye exam yesterday . he said that she is very near sighted , but the diabetes has not affected her eyes at all . that was a relief . she ' s been having headaches , so i was concerned . they probably have been from her blood sugars being out of control . she is doing so much better now . i have stopped waking her up to check it in the night & the levels are so much better . she ' s acting a lot more like her old self now . a lot nicer to me . i guess her sugars out of control & all the stress of tiger dolls was what was wrong with her . she doesn ' t say the cruel things to me that she used to . i knew something had to be wrong with her . i thought surely i had not raised a child with such a mean spirit . anyway things are a lot better .
tell cole that mimi hopes his eye appointment goes as well as lacy ' s . let him call to tell me about it . i hope he gets his teary eye " fixed " .
lacy ' s eye doctor talked more about her teeth almost than he did her eyes . he couldn ' t believe her teeth are so perfect without braces . and she is so tanned , you can see her a mile away with those white teeth shining when she smiles . she has a dentist appointment for cleaning at the first part of next week . we ' ll talk later about when we are coming to your house . i ' m going to longview to a singles retreat sat . in case you call & i ' m not there . will be home sat . night . love ya , mawSubject: lacy ' s eye exam

tom did some footwork and questioning and determined where the additional big cowboy production is coming from . apparently , hpl cut a deal to purchase this gas at " hpl meters " at rocher and big cowboy # 2 , so the gas had been pathed on the gathering agreement into our pipe . all along , these volumes have been flowing into the gepl / big cowboy system and on to king ranch . tom and i spoke with clem about the most correct way to reflect the physical and determined that a transport usage ticket needed to be put into place , as im wellhead , to transfer the volumes from hpl to gepl and into the plant .
we unpathed the gathering agreement and brokered the hpl purchase to the tu tickets and moved the gas on our transport on gepl to the plant , effective april 1 . this resolves our overproduction issues for april and forward .

louis cox with copano ( the interconnecting party at this meter ) informed me that effective march lst , we should have been buying incremental gas from royal production at this point since they were no longer selling it to copano . there have been no changes in the producer services noms at this point , however . this point appears to be on a 14 day chart and the last flow i have access to shows noms of 1332 mm with bav of 3497 mm on march 18 th . bob / vance - could one of you guys check into this and see what the nom should be ? copano says they ' re not getting the gas in april either , but they do not know how long hplc is purchasing the incremental gas from royal . please let me know what the resolution is . thanks .Subject: re : canus meter 5310

louis cox with copano ( the interconnecting party at this meter ) informed me
that effective march lst , we should have been buying incremental gas from
royal production at this point since they were no longer selling it to
copano . there have been no changes in the producer services noms at this
point , however . this point appears to be on a 14 day chart and the last flow
i have access to shows noms of 1332 mm with bav of 3497 mm on march 18 th .
bob / vance - could one of you guys check into this and see what the nom should
be ? copano says they ' re not getting the gas in april either , but they do not
know how long hplc is purchasing the incremental gas from royal . please let
me know what the resolution is . thanks .Subject: wellhead volumes

# 538950 has been updated to show deliveries to mobil refinery off centana ' s pipe for the same time period , same volume

http : / / www . listbot . com /Subject: jill ,
i have had several discussions with daren farmer and below are a few questions remaining .
ann mag - which plant does this gas come into or out of ? daren farmer indicated that ngpl / trunkline is connected to la gloria ( agua dulce ) and tenn / coral / shannel are connected to the gulf plains plant ( agua dulce minus ) . do we have an option on which plant tailgait we would like delivery ? if so daren said we would prefer the gulf plains plant .
oakhill - are all three at the carthage hub ? if so , then the texas desk will give a quote , probably hsc minus , otherwise the east and central desk will need to quote the volume into tetco and koch mid , respectively .
vaquillas ranch km - what plant processes this gas ?
white heron - where is this ? could not find it on the map and daren was not familiar with this field .
sheridan field - daren assumed this was the shell sheridan plant , but he wanted to verify with you .
hungerford north - where is this ?
bear den - where is this ?
moore ' s station - where is this ?
dan hughes - hpl is quoting this volume ( as well as several other field connected to hpl ) and they need a meter number for this field .
we have one less day to get these quotes than originally anticipated because of friday being " good friday " and basically all of the 32 nd floor being out , myself included .
so , let me know via voicemail or email what you can find out regarding the above questions . the properties we do not have any questions on are currently being quoted up , or will be tomorrow morning .
call with any questions

george - i ' ve done some t - accounts ( the bean counter in me ) and i think the following is the best way to handle this going forward :
change the existing deals , 547201 and 591307 , to a zero price . this will eliminate the a / r balance on hpl ' s books for glo , but will keep the volume nom ' d to glo and will not impact ua 4 .
enter a ticket on hpl for a sale to ena for the value of the gas that was zeroed out on the above tickets . this should be entered as a demand charge only and the amounts should be $ 974 , 144 for 1 / 01 and $ 766 , 304 for 2 / 01 .
enter a ticket on ena where the ena - wellhead book purchases the demand from hpl . the amounts would be the same as in # 2 above .
enter a ticket on ena where the ena - wellhead book sells demand to egm for the value of the crude oil for the prior month . for 1 / 01 , the sale would be for $ 886 , 638 . 60 ( the 12 / 00 crude oil delivered to egm by glo ) . for 2 / 01 , the sale would be for $ 839 , 008 . 29 ( the 1 / 01 crude oil delivered to egm by glo ) .
this will require the following steps be taken monthly as this deal goes forward :
the price on the sale from hpl to glo will need to be zeroed out monthly .
the demand charges on steps 2 and 3 will have to be updated to reflect the value zeroed out .
the demand charges on step 4 will have to be updated to reflect the value of the crude delivered to egm .
once this is done , the a / r balance for glo will be cleared , the margin will be on the ena wellhead book , and the intercompany transactions will move the money from egm to hpl . this needs to be done monthly prior to flash , which will prevent any oa variances . the index for the gas value is available shortly after the lst of the month , and since the volume is firm , there shouldn ' t be a problem calculating the value . we should also know the value of the crude oil so that we can flash the sale from ena to egm . if you have any questions or see a better way to do this , please let me know . thanks .

car rental options for enron travelers
rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to :
national car rental ( primary ) and alamo rent - a - car ( secondary ) .
the intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage enron ' s total car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non - pricing provisions ( i . e . insurance ) .
national car rental , due to its service levels , availability and total value proposition , has been awarded primary status and is recommended as the first choice for enron travelers ' needs .
alamo rent - a - car , a sister company to national , has been awarded a contract reflecting a secondary status , due to its service levels , availability and low cost solutions . alamo is recommended as an alternative to national , where available .
when you rent a vehicle in the united states , ( including puerto rico ) or canada , the following insurance provisions are included , regardless of rate selected :
1 . l / dw ( loss / damage waiver ) - this is what is called comprehensive or collision on your personal auto . it covers the rental vehicle and pays for any damage to it .
2 . liability - this covers people and property outside the rental vehicle . for both national and alamo , the coverage is $ 100 , 000 per person , $ 300 , 000 per occurrence and $ 50 , 000 for property damage .
* * important * * *

this is a statement that was read over the pa system at the football game
at roane county high school , kingston , tennessee by school principal jody
mcloud , on september 1 , 2000 . i thought it was worth sharing with the
world , and hope you will forward it to all your friends . it clearly shows
just how far this country has gone in the wrong direction .
" it has always been the custom at roane county high school football games
to say a prayer and play the national anthem to honor god and country .
due to a recent ruling by the supreme court , i am told that saying a prayer
is a violation of federal case law .
as i understand the law at this time , i can use this public facility to
approve of sexual perversion and call it an alternate lifestyle , and if
someone is offended , that ' s ok .
i can use it to condone sexual promiscuity by dispensing condoms and
calling it safe sex . if someone is offended , that ' s ok .
i can even use this public facility to present the merits of killing an
unborn baby as a viable means of birth control . if someone is offended , no
problem .
i can designate a school day as earth day and involve students in
activities to religiously worship and praise the goddess , mother earth ,
and call it ecology .
i can use literature , videos and presentations in the classroom that depict
people with strong , traditional christian convictions as simple minded and
ignorant and call it enlightenment .
however , if anyone uses this facility to honor god and ask him to bless
this event with safety and good sportsmanship , federal case law is
violated .
this appears to be inconsistent at best , and at worst , diabolical .
apparently , we are to be tolerant of everything and anyone except god and
his commandments .
nevertheless , as a school principal , i frequently ask staff and students to
abide by rules which they do not necessarily agree . for me to do otherwise
would be inconsistent at best , and at worst , hypocritical . i suffer from
that affliction enough unintentionally . i certainly do not need to add an
intentional transgression .
for this reason , i shall , " render unto caesar that which is caesar ' s , " and
refrain from praying at this time . however , if you feel inspired to honor ,
praise and thank god , and ask him in the name of jesus to bless this event ,
please feel free to do so . as far as i know , that ' s not against the law -
yet . "
and . . . one by one , the people in the stands bowed their heads , held hands
with one another , and began to pray . they prayed in the stands . they prayed
in the team huddles . they prayed at the concession stand . and they prayed
in the announcer ' s box . the only place they didn ' t pray was in the supreme
court of the united states of america - the seat of " justice " in the one
nation under god .
somehow , kingston , tennessee , remembered what so many have forgotten . . . we
are given the freedom of religion , not the freedom from religion .
praise god that his remnant remains !
let ' s celebrate jesus in 2001
jesus said , " if you are ashamed of me , i will be ashamed of you before my
father . "
- - - - - - - - -
if you are not ashamed , pass this on . . . but only if you mean it .
yes , i do love god . he is my source of existence and savior . he keeps me
functioning each and every day . without him , i will be nothing . without
him , i am nothing but with him , i can do all things through christ that
strengthens me . phil 4 : 13

daren ,
is there any industrial meters in particular i need to watch the imbalances since we are close to the end of the month ?
thanks - julieSubject: pleo 0004 2000
mary ,
as in my email below to daren , we are seeing some oa variances between flash to actual on the ple contracts on pgev for 10 / 00 - 12 / 00 . i have verified with thu nguyen of what the statements from pgev show and that is also what we have booked in unify and recorded to the g / l as an imbalance . however , when looking in cpr ( under cpr pipeline exchange ) , there was not anything flashed for those months , thus our oa variance . i seem to remember that stacy once said that although we may run an imbalance at the end of a month on occassion , in those few times that we do , 1 ) it should be relatively small and 2 ) in the following days of the next month , we should have worked the imbalance down to zero thus having no imbalance at the end of the month . in a voice mail from daren today , he seemed to think the same thing was happening or even that by the end of each month , we were balanced to zero . can you shed some light on these months and let me know if we should have had an imbalance and if we should have , why there would have not been anything flashed . if we should not have had an imbalance , then we ' ll need your help to figure out what went wrong in that pgev shows an imbalance on their statements . let me know what you think . . . . . . . . .
thanks ,

lee ,
our cold box will probably not have feed into it until mid may at the earliest .
this means that we will continue to have a large volume of refinery gas going to
fuel . we are nominating the minimum of 80 bbtu / d knowing that we should start
the month well short of the 80 with the volumes increasing as the month
progresses and the cold box comes on line . call me if you have any questions .
brianSubject: re : big cowboy / gepl actuals for february
please see the attached xcel file . i think that i have found the missing volumes on big cowboy . there are two wells connected to system 429 , which flows into the big cowboy system and interconnects with hgpl at meter 8284 . they are meters 986679 ( currently in trade zone 18 ) and 986742 ( currently in trade zone 1 ) . i think that these should probably both be reassigned to trade zone 21 . this should resolve our volumetric issue .
donna & george ,
please let me know if my assumption is in error . i have a schematic that shows these meters going to hgpl off of gepl big cowboy , however , if this is not correct then i will need to try to find the gas in another manner .
thank you for your time . please let me know if you have any questions , comments , suggestions .

thu ,
we have an ongoing issue every month between what we nominate from gepl into hgpl and on to king ranch ( flows into hgpl at meter 8284 ) and what is in the system as purchase gas upstream of the meter . the volume has been anywhere from 6 , 000 to 10 , 000 / day over the nomination for at least the past six months . would you please fax the meter statements from gepl for february so that i can try to determine which meters are flowing over what is nominated and verify that we have deals in the system for each offsystem meter . should you require a more specific listing , i have tom ' s schematic of the area .

bob ,
hplc continues to purchase gas from both ocean and seneca on a term basis ; firm tickets were submitted for april origination beginning with the month of april . as for as barrett , they are selling their gas under a joa with seneca ; therefore , 100 % of barrett ' s production is being paid to seneca . consequently , you should see tickets in sitara for both counterparties .
let me know is you can ' t .

on oasis and pgev , we have been buying and selling as hpl . however , we have been transporting the gas under ena . this is primarily for spot and base deals . we want to keep these transport contracts with ena . the only term deal we have at waha is to tufco ( 0 - 60 , 000 / day ) . this deal is under ena with it ' s own firm transport contract ( now on guadalupe pipeline , which was previously teco / pgev ) . the sale and transport will go with hpl . the sale to entex off of oasis ( currently under the ena , will be assigned to hpl ) must be served off of oasis . so hpl will need to acquire an oasis contract for this deal . let me know if you have any more questions .

hplc continues to purchase gas from both ocean and seneca on a term basis ; firm tickets were submitted for april origination beginning with the month of april . as for as barrett , they are selling their gas under a joa with seneca ; therefore , 100 % of barrett ' s production is being paid to seneca . consequently , you should see tickets in sitara for both counterparties .

thanks , bob . it now turns out that due to operational issues , the additional 10 , 000 / d may not come on next week . spinnaker is having problems dealing with all the condensate associated with this gas and may not have the proper equipment in place to allow the additional gas to flow and also handle the additional condensate associated with that gas . i ' ll keep you posted .

bob , we currently have a total of 16 . 817 mmbtu / d nominated for purchases at meter 098 - 9862 as follows :
spinnaker exploration company , l . l . c sit 379424 5 , 886 / d 27 %
ranger oil company sit 533410 5 , 886 / d 27 %
the houston exploration company sit 535119 5 , 045 / d 23 %
it appears that the texas general land office transport volume is not properly included in sitara for may - see deal 535132 , which shows 0 as the expectted volume . texas glo has historically transported about 23 % of the gas at the n . padre is . block 883 l .
once it starts flowing , the incremental 10 , 000 mmbtu / d should be allocated to the deals mentioned above based on the proportions shown above .

the texas general land office transport volume is in pops for may nominated at 4 , 800 / d . deal # 535132 was initially set up as a wellhead purchase from texas general land office . the transport volume of 4 , 800 / d comprises approximately 22 % of the total volume nominated at the meter .

the houston exploration company sit 535119 5 , 045 / d 23 %
it appears that the texas general land office transport volume is not properly included in sitara for may - see deal 535132 , which shows 0 as the expectted volume . texas glo has historically transported about 23 % of the gas at the n . padre is . block 883 l .
once it starts flowing , the incremental 10 , 000 mmbtu / d should be allocated to the deals mentioned above based on the proportions shown above .

Subject: cliff baxter
it is with sadness and regret that we announce that cliff baxter is resigning as an employee of enron . we are happy , though , that cliff ' s primary reason for resigning is to spend more time with his family .
cliff is a unique talent . his creativity , intelligence , sense of humor , and straightforward manner have been assets to the company throughout his career . he will be missed .
cliff joined enron in 1991 and was a key member of the team that built enron ' s wholesale business . before becoming vice chairman of enron , cliff served in a variety of positions in enron ' s wholesale businesses , culminating in his appointment as chairman and chief executive officer of enron north america in 1999 .
we have asked cliff , and he has agreed , to continue in a consulting role for the company while concluding negotiations on a number of key asset dispositions .
please join us in thanking cliff for his service to the company and in wishing him the very best .Subject: calpine daily gas nomination

did we exchange with panenergy in april ? if we did , can you send me your nom sheet ? meter 7052 - castle busby looks different this month . elsa did some deals with highland energy at 7052 . we normally buy all of the gas from duke at this meter when we exchange . there also wasn ' t flow every day , so duke ' s volume is very small .
thanks ,

by the way what is your new address ? i may want to come by some evening with a lawn chair and a 6 pack . watching you work sounds better than anything on tv .
you will make a good trader . good relationships and flexible pricing are all you need . oh , and a few zillion other intangibles you will run into . it beats the hell out of most other things though .

questions based on the information in the facilitation by location report :
1 . meter 9643 hgpl / hpl - stratton , tejones operating corporation , sitara 266970 : should this purchase be at meter 9638 , freeman prod - maxine field in trade zone 18 ?
2 . i presume we are not counting both meter 9848 north padre island blk 8 and meter 9862 lehman / spinnaker onshore . isn ' t this the same gas ?
3 . meter 3536 seahawk / a - s ( mat plt 520 ) , eog resources , sitara 725391 : is this purchase properly in the wellhead book ?
4 . meter 6884 pgtt junction 16 " lease , comstock oil & gas , inc . and kerr - mcgee oil & gas onshore l . p . , sitara 125899 and 132975 : comstock ' s volume should exceed kerr - mcgee ' s volume , and together the two volumes should be approximately 73 , 000 / d . currently , comstock ' s volume is only 8 , 600 / d and kerr - mcgee ' s volume is 25 , 000 / d . we look about 38 , 000 / d short .
5 . meter 639 hannah nash , coral energy resources , l . p . , sitara 659998 : is this purchase properly in the wellhead book ?
i ' m looking at about 10 other old deals that i think should be in for may , but aren ' t . in addition , i ' m adding in the new deals that will flow in may . i ' ll be done by noon .

daren ,
we are not receiving timely information from the hub regarding our park and lend agreement . i have not received an update since tues or wed of last week . mike has been phoning them furiously for information and has been told that they don ' t have it , or it will be ready later . per gisb , final scheduled numbers on epng , nng , and tw are reported at 9 : 00 am the following day ( ie . sunday final will be out at 9 am on mon . ) . prior to the transition from pg & e , we received our balance by 9 : 15 or 9 : 30 am . i realize that the transition has been difficult , they are never a cake walk , however , this type of information is crucial . further , they have not provided any final numbers for the month of april , we should at least be able to receive a " best available " number , and the interstate pipes , due to gisb , have final scheduled numbers available on the first of the month . i submit that ena should not be held liable for payment of the $ 0 . 03 / day rate , as we have not received the information we need to balance the agreement . if epgt plans to administer fees , then balance information should be communicated on a timely basis . we may want to check the terms of the agreement , and / or negotiate a reduced rate for the month of may .

subject : please read , sign , and pass on .
though she ' s dead and has just been located , after 5 years , this lady
continues to haunt us from her shallow grave .
get this :
cbs will be forced to discontinue " touched by an angel " for using the word
god in every program . madeline murray o ' hare , an atheist , successfully
managed to eliminate the use of bible reading from public schools a few
years ago . now her organization has been granted a federal hearing on the
same subject by the federal communications commission ( fcc ) in washington ,
dc . their petition , number 2493 , would ultimately pave the way to stop the
reading of the gospel our lord and savior , and the airwaves of america .
they got 287 , 000 signatures to back their stand ! if this attempt is
successful , all sunday worship services being broadcast on the radio or by
television will be stopped . this group is also campaigning to remove all
christmas programs and christmas carols from public schools ! ! you as a
christian can help !
we are praying for at least 1 million signatures . this would defeat their
effort and how that there are many christians alive , well and concerned
about our country . as christians we must unite on this .
please don ' t take this lightly . we ignored this lady once and lost prayer in
our school and in offices across the nation .
please stand up for your religious freedom and let your voice be heard .
together we
can make a difference in our country while creating an opportunity
for the lost to know the lord .
please press " forward " , clean up the message , and forward this to everyone
that you think should read this .
now , please sign your name at the bottom ( you can only add your name after
you have pressed the " forward " ) .
don ' t delete any other names , just go to the next number and type your name .
please do not sign jointly , such as mr . & mrs . each person should sign
his / her own name .
please e - mail this to everyone that you think needs to read this , and help
us defeat this organization and keep the right of our freedom of religion .

bobSubject: opportunity on dow pipeline
darren , per our earlier conversation , here are the facts related to the opportunity to service a plant in the freeport area off of dow .
the potential customer ( don owen ) has supplied this plant for the past 15 years , buying supply from dow .
dow does not want to be a supplier in the future , but of course , will transport .
dow will quote only a 2 year transport ( $ 0 . 06 from katy to the plant ) , but the customer wants a minimum of 5 years .
other bids he is getting at index + . 03 / . 04 less whatever transport .
the swing load is approx . 1300 - 1350 mmbtu / d , but fairly steady he says .
let me know if you have any interest or if i should pass this along to someone else . thanks .
ps the customer will give more info if we are interested , but wanted to see if we have interest first ( and also if we had long term capacity on dow )Subject: lacy
hey - - just thought i ' d let you know that lacy went to school this morning - pale & not feeling well - - stomach still hurts , but she went ahead . she ' s stressing me out big time . she acted like she couldn ' t hardly move , but i came back in the house & she was talking fine on the telephone . but i ask her questions about how she feels & she is just about dead . i don ' t know about her . but she looked pale . blood sugar was a little low this morning . i woke her up at 2 & had her check it & it was good . so i got a little more rest . i don ' t think she even woke up enough to remember it . i don ' t think the little job is good for her if she ' s gonna catch everything they have . she ' s so careless about washing hands after handling all those nasty little kids & then bites her nails . not good ! anyway , i ' m stressed big time over her & over her driving the car . and missing so much school . i wasn ' t going to take her to the dr . yesterday because she was better so i figured it was a virus , b !
ut she had to have a note from a doctor or she ' s gonna have to make up school on saturday & they ' ve threatened to fine me . so i had to pay $ 30 for them to tell me that she had a virus & missed a day of work . oh , well , life is fun . anyway , i need to quit gettin down over such trivial things cause there ' s so many with worse problems to face . i am thankful that the burdens are so light . but you can still pray for us . and encourage lacy to work at splash town ! ha !
remind me to tell you about the terroristic threat at high school . another high stress time ! can ' t wait until this weekend to see all my cousins & ya ' ll . kiss my grandsons for me . love yaSubject: hpl nom for may 16 , 2001

yes , the dollar amount is what we need to recoup from williams . i will take the credit with our payment to williams on the 25 th . tenaska will send us their wire to us on the 24 th . i will make sure we receive the wire from tenaska before i send the wire to williams . i will also let james know about the volume for the agency fee . i thought it was suppose to be calculated on actual volume , not the nominated volume .

i have changed the demand fee . but , is this adjusted by the dollar amount that we need to recoup from williams ? i don ' t want to pay tenaska until we get the money from williams . additionally , i believe that we need to keep the volume at 45 , 000 for the admin fee , since we originally nominated 45 , 000 / day .

please find attached spreadsheet that compares hot days from may 2000 and may 2001 . there are two tabs , one tab contains the days may 16 - 18 , 2000 and the other tab contains the days may 14 - 18 , 2001 . each tab contains both the load data and temp data particular to the days in question . the days most directly comparable are may 17 , 2001 ( thursday ) and may 18 , 2000 ( thursday ) , although the two days preceding may 18 , 2000 were slightly warmer than the two days preceding may 17 , 2001 . the peak on 5 / 17 / 2001 , 44 , 923 mw , is 2 . 78 % higher than the peak on 5 / 18 / 2000 , 43 , 709 mw . with similarly warm days before 5 / 17 / 2001 as there were before 5 / 18 / 2000 , the peak would obviously have been even higher . this would put the year - over - year growth in excess of 3 % . i believe this falls right in line with the growth rate year - over - year from an earlier analysis , somewhere in the range of 3 . 5 % to 4 % .

hi ,
the number is 281 - 370 - 7838 .
i did not think of it , but without the pipe one has to balance ones own , doesn ' t one . of course the major problem was the people with hpl , not the counter - parties . who ' s doing that for you guys ?
jen came home for the memorial day weekend so we just bummed around . saw pearl harbor , watched a few dvd ' s , and ate way to much .
when you get time let us know about your " bad luck " . i hope jake wasn ' t helping you too much .
i have been occupying much to much time with our new sound system . we finally chucked our little bookshelf unit and got a pile of yamaha stuff coupled to an equally large stack of klipsch speakers . awesome is the only word to apply . i ' m sure the neighbors are loving the old people next door .

can you clarify for me how the agency fee is suppose to be calculated ? i am getting mixed information . i know that we use the higher of the two volumes ( receipts vs . deliveries ) . the question is do we use the nom volume or the actual volume . last month ( march ) , we left the volume at the nom of 45 , 000 / day . in the past , we have changed the volume to the actual daily volume . for april , the actuals are higher than the nom and we would need to bump the volume up to 47 , 089 / day . james armstrong is using the actual volume . the deal for the fee is 514353 .
my other problem is that the spreadsheet is choosing the max of three volumes , receipts , deliveries and transport . should the transport volume be in the calculation ? also , mark added some payback volume to the spreadsheet and it is being included in the receipt volume . do i include the payback volume in the calculation of the agency fee if we use the nom ? if you have a copy of the contract that addresses the agency fee , i would like to have a copy . you can fax it to 713 - 571 - 3141 . if none of this makes sense , give me a call and i can try and explain further .
thanks ,

i ' m assuming that since this deal is on the new texas desk , and that no new deals have been negotiated under ces counterparties that this deal is actually a truncated deal that was split to move open production from ena - im texas ( which i believe no longer exists as part of the post - hpl / aep processes ) to ena - im lonestar . the deals have been split several times anderson , bridgette ; campos , anthony ; gonzales , sharon

i was researching deal 819348 ( ces - midcon texas gas services corp ) and found that it was incorrectly attached to contract 96035432 ( in fact , the gtc firm had three deals attached ) . since one of the deals ended 03 / 31 / 01 , we won ' t bother correcting that one , but this deal needs to be moved . i set up contract 96061912 and attached it today . this deal still needs to be reviewed by cyndie before the cp is inactivated .

1757978Subject: re : gas nom ' s
we ' ve talked this over at this end and agree we should be taking the following approach :
remind brazos that under exhibit 7 . 12 , page 2 of the ppa , brazos is precluded on any gas day from taking a greater volume of gas than the plant ' s mdq ( 45 , 000 dth / d ) less the amount needed to satisfy its generation request .
the partnership will accept total gas nominations as generation first , gas for resale second . if brazos ' electric nominations by hour would , given ambient conditions , cause us to use at or above the plant ' s mdq under its contracts with apache / williams ( 45 , 000 dth / d ) , gas nominations will be zero . this needs to be handled between the operators . i ' ve emphasized " at or above " on purpose ; if an all electric nomination would cause brazos to burn in excess of 45 , 000 dth per day , we will honor that request ( we ' re looking at this with the attorneys and may choose at a future date to change the way this has been administered in the past , as this situation currently causes the partnership to incur an economic loss ) .
after being notified of the need for a schedule adjustment , brazos is free to reset its hourly electric nominations to allow for gas deliveries to the extent it desires ( provided they ' re still capped at 45 , 000 dth / d if they take gas ) . whenever they go this route , however , we need to hold them to the electric nomination ( i . e . , they should get a courtesy call from an operator each and every time they go over the nominated electricity amount ) . remind brazos that under the ppa , they will be billed for penalties associated with not adhering to their electric nominations on days on which they ' ve elected to take gas .
if the issue of precedent comes up , remind them that we ' re operating in a new territory and that electric - gas nominations have only been made over the past 7 months ; it wasn ' t until recently that we ' ve been able to attribute imbalance penalties to brazos , which has caused us to look at the scheduling provisions of the agreement much more closely .
as a show of good faith , we should also make an attempt to track gas consumed / nominated for redelivery and advise them toward the end of the month of opportunities to up their gas nominations .
hope this helps to clarify where we are .

chuck ,
i just wanted to make sure everyone has the same undertstanding of the gas
nominations and usage issue . today with this most recent daily nomination
revision from brazos , brazos ( waco ) now understands that we are going to hold
them to 45 , 000 mbtu ' s when they are requesting electrical generation and gas
energy . however , i want everone of us to understand that a nomination from
brazos for a 6312 mwh , s ( 263 / hr ) , will require the plant to utilize 47 , 500 to
48 , 500 mbtu ' s at this ambient temperature to deliver the requested energy .
to allow brazos any gas the total delivered electrical energy would have to
be something less than 258 mw loading per hour .

daren , sitara has two different prices for may 31 , 2001 causing a problem .
according to lee papayoti , the price for the swing volumes should
behsc _ flw + 1 high . gdp . d . a . however it is priced at hsc . gdp . d . a with the 31 st
being priced at both . this is causing settlements to be overstated by
419 mmbtu and $ 1 , 432 . 66 . any help you could give would be greatly
appreciated . my phone # is 713 - 571 - 3273 .

for immediate release
june 26 , 2001
espn to launch sidelines network ' s second reality - based series to
premiere with texas a & m football
espn will launch a 13 - episode , prime - time series this fall entitled
sidelines , the network ' s second reality - based title under the espn
original
entertainment ( eoe ) banner . sidelines will document the season of a
prominent team as told through the eyes and ears of the less visible ,
less
celebrated people who are involved with the team . the football aggies
of
texas a & m will be the focus of the series ' premiere episodes to begin
october 5 .
" coach slocum and i made the decision to be a part of this exciting
venture
with espn , " texas a & m athletics director wally groff said . " we couldn ' t
be
more thrilled that espn has chosen texas a & m for this series . the
opportunity espn gave us to showcase this wonderful institution and all
of
its tradition and heritage is something we could not pass up . "
in a " docu - drama " style , the various stories that surround the team will
be
explored through the voices and actions of people whose day - to - day lives
are
directly affected by living in the town and / or going to the school .
players
and coaches will also be visible and heard from in a more peripheral
fashion , but will not be the primary focus .
" this is a good opportunity for texas a & m university and we ' re delighted
espn decided to feature the football program and some of the people
behind
the scenes , " head coach r . c . slocum said . " we look forward to working
with
them . "
the participants will be drawn from a cross section of people who
reflect
every aspect of the university and college station , texas . they will be
students , faculty , media , local storeowners , mothers , fathers and some
of
the high school seniors who aspire to attend the university .
" each person has a role to play with the team , as well as a personal
story , "
said mark shapiro , vice president and general manager , espn original
entertainment . " sidelines will see each person grow in character as the
season progresses - - a kind of ' soap - umentary . ' we ' ll weave the smaller
personal stories together through the bigger story of the progression
and
fate of the team and its season . "
sidelines : texas a & m storylines
- - this is the 125 th anniversary of the school ' s founding ( 1876 ) .
- - the community is still very much dealing with the 1999 bonfire
collapse
which tragically killed 12 students almost two years ago . a 90 - year
tradition came to a tumultuous end . dealing with the loss and the
emotional
toll it took on faculty members , students and families will be an
important
part of this series . the bonfire will return in 2002 but will take on a
different form than has been tradition .
- - texas a & m , who lost a wild , snowy independence bowl last year in
overtime
to mississippi state 43 - 41 , will play notre dame ( at home ) , texas ,
oklahoma ,
kansas st and colorado next year . a tough schedule will provide for
great
drama .
- - the school invented the phrase " 12 th man " and actually owns the
trademark .
one game , the aggies were low on players and had a student suit up and
stand
ready just in case he was needed . ever since , a student is chosen for
every
home game to suit up and play on the kickoff team .
- - billy pickard is in charge of maintaining the facilities . he ' s been at
the
university for 36 years and was the student trainer for bear bryant ' s
a & m
team . he was actually in junction , texas for bryant ' s infamous grueling
summer camp . the story of it was a best - selling book , the junction boys .
- - at midnight on the friday night before every home game , a "
30 , 000
fans show up each week for this time - honored tradition .
eoe , the newest franchise of espn programming , will develop a
wide - variety
of branded programming outside of the network ' s traditional event and
sports
news genres . using a collection of vehicles - - game shows , documentaries
or
reality - based shows - it ' s espn ' s goal to broaden its audience by
appealing
to younger and casual sports fans . in addition , the company is
exploring
new ways to connect with consumers by applying these projects across all
platforms of the espn family - television , internet , radio

that i need to finish it :
january 2000 - i need deal # 854688 pathed for epgt and for tetc . according to the invoice , we should have
11 , 129 dth on the interconnect .
february 2000 - i need deal # 871184 pathed for hpl and chan . hpl should have 3 , 600 dth and chan should
have 11 , 500 dth on the interconnect .
july 2000 - deal # 871172 has an interconnect issue . according to mops contract # 105124 , they received 8 , 275 dth
on the matagorda 624 , but according to epgt , they delivered 10 , 362 dth to hpl ( ? ) could this possibly
need to be split somehow , or do you have any other ideas ?
let me know . thanks , gloria 3 - 7118Subject: new tax law update
whether you ' re investing for your kids ' education or your retirement , the
new federal tax law may make your goals easier to reach . the $ 1 . 35 - trillion
tax relief package could affect your finances in many areas , from investing
for college and retirement to managing income and estate taxes .
many of the tax cuts will phase in gradually over the next several years .
but to help you take advantage of all possible provisions , we should start
planning soon . some of the ways you may benefit include :
lower income tax rates . the gradual reduction of tax rates has already
begun . in fact , the new withholding schedule went into effect on july 1 .
and , you should receive a tax rebate check soon due to the creation of a new
10 % bottom rate retroactive to january 1 , 2001 . as tax rates fall over the
next few years , your disposable income will likely rise - offering an
opportunity to invest more toward your various goals .
education - funding incentives . parents who want to help their children attend
college may now find their financial task easier . the tax relief act will
improve education savings tools such as :
? education iras - the accounts ' contribution limit will rise from $ 500 to
$ 2 , 000 in 2002 . what ' s more , money in these accounts can now be used for
elementary and secondary school costs in addition to higher education
expenses .
? state sponsored 529 college savings plans - also beginning in 2002 ,
distributions from these plans for qualified education expenses will be tax
free . currently earnings in the accounts are deferred and taxed at the
beneficiary ' s rate upon withdrawal . 529 s are particularly attractive due to
their generous contribution limits .
? deductions for education expenses - the act increases eligibility for
student loan interest deductions and it creates a new deduction for higher
education expenses .
? the child tax credit - though not tied specifically to education expenses ,
this credit will provide increasing help to parents investing for college .
previously $ 500 per qualifying child under 17 , the credit increases to $ 600
in 2001 - 2004 , $ 700 in 2005 - 2008 , $ 800 in 2009 and $ 1 , 000 in 2010 and
thereafter .
higher retirement plan contribution limits . the tax act will allow people
with earned income to invest more in retirement plans and iras - possibly
helping them retire sooner and more comfortably . your options may include :
? traditional and roth iras - annual contribution limits for both of these
types of iras will gradually rise from $ 2 , 000 this year to $ 5 , 000 in 2008 .
after that , the limits will be indexed to inflation in $ 500 increments .
? 401 ( k ) s and 403 ( b ) s - working individuals also may be able to invest more
in their employer retirement plan . the limit on elective deferrals will
gradually rise from $ 10 , 500 this year to $ 15 , 000 in 2006 , and this doesn ' t
include the catch - up contribution provision for people 50 years and older .
and much more . there are other provisions in the new tax law that may
benefit you and your family . when we meet , we ' ll identify the ones that
apply to you and help you make the most of them .
as you can see , the new tax law provides meaningful tax savings in a number
of areas . but because the changes will be phased in gradually - and some are
set to expire after 2010 without reauthorization - your planning must be

attention : houston - based outlook users
the global messaging team is proud to announce that beginning today , monday july 16 th , houston - based enron employees that have been migrated to outlook will be able to securely access their enron email from anywhere on the web . this means that if you can get on to the internet , you can access your enron email with outlook web access ( owa ) without having to dial in to enron ' s network . please note that this is not available to those users still on lotus notes but will be available once they are migrated to outlook .
once on the internet , type mail . enron . com in your browser address window and supply your enron network logon credentials as username and password . for example :
username : jdoe 4
password : * * * * * * * *
once you log in , outlook web access opens your enron email mailbox . outlook web access ( owa ) allows you to send and receive mail , perform calendar tasks and manage your mail and contacts , as well as access your mailbox folders . at this time , public folders are not accessible via owa . please keep in mind that outlook web access is a browser - based version of what you might use in the office , so the functionality may be slightly different and some features of outlook 2000 may not be available at all . additionally , owa is only supported using internet explorer 5 . x only and not supported with netscape .
outlook web access is the standard email package for connecting to your enron mail from home , whether you are using an enron - issued home pc , an internet connection with your personal home pc , or your clickathome pc . we will not support the use of the full outlook installation for home use .
outlook web access for remote locations and european / apac enron sites is currently being addressed and will be available soon . at this time , owa is only available if your mailbox resides on a houston mail server .

clarissa - thanks so much for all your help with this pipe ! everything looks great . i just have a couple of paths
that i need to finish it :
january 2000 - i need deal # 854688 pathed for epgt and for tetc . according to the invoice , we should have
11 , 129 dth on the interconnect .
february 2000 - i need deal # 871184 pathed for hpl and chan . hpl should have 3 , 600 dth and chan should
have 11 , 500 dth on the interconnect .
july 2000 - deal # 871172 has an interconnect issue . according to mops contract # 105124 , they received 8 , 275 dth
on the matagorda 624 , but according to epgt , they delivered 10 , 362 dth to hpl ( ? ) could this possibly
need to be split somehow , or do you have any other ideas ?

i need the following . . . . . . . .
assume we are in the new building and we have technical problems that force us out of the building either due to it connection issues or problems with the building itself ( ac , power , etc . ) . if we do have to leave the plan is to have the 30 th floor completely available in this building as a backup for both the gas and power side . obviously space is limited so what we will do is only bring the people that need to be in the building to get noms out and send the others home to handle business remotely . one approach is to take the edi pipes and have them go to the 30 th floor to ensure they have the support and quicker system then if they did their noms from home . using this approach , and considering the space constraint please give me the number of desks you will need on the 30 th floor . i ' m open to suggestions so if you have a different approach or some good ideas feel free to share them . i need this by friday 7 / 27 no later than noon .

during the first six months after the move to the new building , it has recommended that the 30 th floor be maintained in case of any emergency .
what we have to do is come up with the list of critical personnel . there will be very limited seating ,
these should be just the people to finish the day when ever that happens .

george ,
please read megan ' s e - mail below . the spreadsheet for may did not reflect any nomination for killiam oil . did the contract with killiam terminate ? should we be purchasing from meter ( s ) 5427 and / or 6831 and , if so , from what counterparty ? please advise . thanks .

i need some help with killam oil for may 2001 . they called me yesterday
asking about their may payment because they hadn ' t received it yet . i
looked in path manager and saw that we did not have any deals with them in
may . in april , we paid them for gas at hpl meters 985427 and 986831 ( deal
742826 and 742829 ) . the gas at these meters has been put on hpl ' s
strangers gas contract in pops for may . do you know why we do not have any
deals at these meters for may ? i was told by charles howard that there is
a pending assignment for these meters form hurd to killam . he said for
june 2001 , aep paid hurd . do you know who we are suppose to pay for may ?
i would appreciate any help you can give me .
thanks ,

meganSubject: glo deals 2001
darren :
here is my problem . as you know , hplc did a deal with texas general land office where we would exchange gas for crude . the problem was hplc was selling the gas and enron gas marketing was receiving the crude . bryce baxter worked out a series of intercompany deals between hplc , ena and egm that would book the deal correctly . julie meyers was told how to create the deals and she completed january and february , except for one small part , but march forward was never completed . the attached word document explains the procedure . basically , we were suppose to book an hplc sale to the tglo with volume and zero price . this would book the volume to the gl and zero out the receivable since we were never going to receive cash from tglo . then , we would book a sale from hplc - wellhead to ena - wellhead for the value of the gas only ( no volume ) and a sale from ena - wellhead to egm for the value of the crude ( no volume ) . for these deals , we would use demand fees . egm will pay ena for the crude dollars .
i will give you the deals for january so you can see how the dollars move . you will see that the price is still on the sale from hplc to tglo . julie zeroed this out , but o ' neal put it back . i ' ve left him a message to find out why .
1 . sale from hplc - im wellhead to tglo 547201
2 . sale from hplc - im hplc to hplc - im wellhead 547205
3 . sale from hplc - wellhead to ena - im wellhead texas 679847
4 . sale from ena - im wellhead texas to egm 679859
here is a preliminary list of what needs to be done to finish out the transactions for march , april and may . the previous email went to kam keiser , john grass , linda roberts and dayem khandker . they may be able to help us work through this . let me know if you have any questions .
1 . zero out the prices on the hplc sales to texas general land office , leave volume only .
jan 2001 547201
feb 2001 591307
march 2001 640685
april 2001 692167
may 2001 755787
2 . enter a ticket for the hpl - wellhead sale to ena - wellhead for march , april and may 2001 ( the feb deal number is 679848 ) for the value of the gas below . this should be entered as a demand fee only , no volume .
march 2001 $ 774 , 612 . 50
april 2001 $ 705 , 870 . 00
may 2001 $ 664 , 609 . 00
3 . enter a ticket for the sale from ena - wellhead to egm for the value of the crude below . there is an existing ticket for jan and feb that can be extended , deal 679859 .
march 2001 $ 757 , 603 . 93
april 2001 $ 820 , 983 . 94
may 2001 $ 598 , 885 . 13
4 . update jan and feb crude values on deal 679859
jan 2001 change $ 886 , 638 . 63 to $ 886 , 015 . 18

sherlyn ,
the pops meters 7107 , 7108 , and 7109 need to stay non allocatable and need to be allocated on unit gas pipeline . you will need daren or michael at enron to do the following
add meters 7107 , 7108 and 7109 on unit pipeline to sitara deals 70550
70549
70119
then you can run the pops 53 report for these meters or use your allocation to properly allocate to the meters on unit pipeline .
once this is done , let me know and i will zero out the pops meters .

just so you know , this is what i sent redmond about that 311 case .

subject : fw : section 311
brian , this is a pretty good explanation of the case thus far . . . . . .
commissioner wood is aware of the conflict between pg & e ( now epgt ) and southern union , probably because of lobbying by southern union , and that is why he raised the issue . southern union states in its initial brief ( # 9 below ) that it opposes the high demand rates that it says epgt proposes to charge for a service that does not incorporate the consumer protections of order no . 636 and argues that ferc should impose order no . 636 standards on pg & e . i was watching a video stream of the meeting , and the whole discussion seemed to come out of nowhere .
here are the facts in this case .
1 ) on december 20 , 1999 , pg & e texas pipeline , lp ( the predecessor to epgt texas pipeline , lp ) filed a petition with ferc for approval of transportation rates under section 311 along , as they were required to do . ( all intrastate pipelines that perform section 311 service must either have their rates approved by ferc or they must charge rates that are approved by a state regulatory body for a similar service . ) pg & e ' s filing proposed , in addition to the usual interruptible service , a firm section 311 service as well as an interruptible parking and lending service . pg & e also filed a revised statement of operating conditions to reflect the new services .
2 ) on february 25 , 2000 , southern union gas company , an intrastate transportation customer of pg & e , filed a late motion to intervene and raised issues which it stated should be addressed in a hearing . pg & e opposed the late intervention , but ferc granted it on april 14 , 2000 . ( pg & e stated that southern union was intervening in order to gain leverage in renegotiating its contract for intrastate service . )
3 ) southern union submitted data requests to pg & e on april 13 and april 17 . pg & e attempted to get a protective order issued , but ferc rejected their request .
4 ) a settlement conference was held on september 7 , 2000 .
5 ) a staff panel was convened on october 2 , 2000 , in order to conduct an advisory , non - evidentiary proceeding for oral arguments on the issues , with instructions to make recommendations to the commission within 90 days .
6 ) on november 1 , 2000 , ferc requested 5 pages of additional information from pg & e in order to complete the application in the proceeding , which pg & e provided on november 8 th . on december 8 th , pg & e provided additional information in response to a ferc data request .
7 ) on january 10 , 2001 , southern union submitted a proposed alternative to the cost of service and rate design that was filed by pg & e .
8 ) on january 17 , el paso field services informed ferc that pg & e texas pipeline , lp had been acquired by el paso on december 22 , 2000 , and that the name was changed to epgt texas pipeline , lp .
9 ) on january 24 , 2001 , epgt texas and southern union filed initial briefs .
10 ) on july 17 , 2001 , epgt filed supplemental comments in response to the discussion at ferc summarized below , where commissioner wood inquired about the extension of some order no . 636 and 637 provisions to section 311 service providers . epgt stated that , if ferc proceeds with this policy , it should do so in a generic rulemaking and not in an individual pipeline proceeding . on july 30 , 2001 , southern union filed reply comments opposing epgt ' s supplemental comments .
11 ) on august 3 , epgt filed an amended statement of operating conditions , which provides for electronic nominations , two additional nomination cycles , bumping , clarified and updated credit provisions , modified quality provisions to protect system integrity , and more clearly defined authorized overrun service .
the ngpa gives ferc authority over intrastate pipeline rates for section 311 service and requires that such service be provided on a non - discriminatory basis , but there is some question as to whether it gives ferc authority to require , for example , compliance with order nos . 636 and 637 .
please let me know if this is enough detail ( or maybe it ' s more than you wanted ! ! ) .Subject: fw : tufco deal 108058

jay smithSubject: new enrononline functionality
in order to continually develop and make improvements to the functionality of enrononline we are rolling out several changes tonight , which will be in effect on monday august 20 , 2001 . some of these changes will affect stack manager while others affect the website . a summary of these changes is listed below .
stack manager changes
top of stack limit orders - this feature will allow the price submitted via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the trader ' s stack price . stack manger will list the price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the floated stack window . orders will be queued by price and time stamp . when a counterparty trades on a " top of stack entry " it will create back to back transactions ; one between enron and the counterparty submitting the order , and the other between enron and the counterparty clicking on the website .
in order to turn on this functionality select the " allowed top of stack " option , in the orders section of the product properties page . if regular limit order functionality is desired the " allowed " option should be selected .
please note that this feature will be released in a disabled mode and will be turned on sometime next week after determining which business units want to roll this out .
restricted top of stack limit orders - this feature will allow the price submitted only by internal traders via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the trader ' s stack price . stack manger will list price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the floated stack window . orders will be queued by price and time stamp . when a counterparty trades on a " top of stack entry " it will create back to back transactions one between enron and the counterparty submitting the order , and the other between enron and the counterparty clicking on the website .
in order to turn on this functionality select the " allowed as restricted top of stack " option , in the orders section of the product properties page . if regular limit order functionality is desired the " allowed " option should be selected . if a product has active orders against it you will not be able to select the " restricted top of stack " feature .
advanced filtering ability on all products tab - drop down filtering capability is now available for each field in the all products tab in stack manager . in order to filter click on the arrow next to the field title . a drop down box with a list of attributes will appear . highlight the attribute by which you wish to filter . to turn off the filter click on the arrow and select the " all " option from the drop down box .
website changes
new submission screen for restricted top of stack limit orders - the submission screen for products that allow top of stack or restricted top of stack limit orders is as follows .
the submit button on the left makes a submission for a normal transaction , while the button on the right will submit as a limit order . in case of the restricted top of stack limit orders only internal traders will see the new submission box .
price of limit orders
modify limit orders
customers now have the ability to modify the price of any active order . in order to do so highlight the order to be modified and use the plus or minus sign next to the price field on at the top of the " today ' s orders " section . the price will move up or down in the same increments as the tick size for that product . once the price is at the desired level click the " set " button and the price will be modified . another way to modify the price on a limit order is to click on the price field on a particular limit order . you will see a box with plus , minus and set buttons that allow you to modify that order .
expiration time for limit orders
customers can now place limit orders with expiration times of up to 30 days . currently they may place orders for only up to 12 hours .
float the today ' s orders section
you can now float the " limit order " section . in order to do so , right click in the " today ' s orders " section and select the float window option . in order to make the window " stay on top " right click on the floated window and select the stay on top option .
mid market client - mid market originators will now have the ability to transact on behalf of their customers , while including their desired margin on the trade , on enrononline products . in order to do so click on the bid or offer price , a customised submission window will appear . select the counterparty for whom you wish to transact from a drop down list , enter the desired customer price and margin and click submit . for example if a customer wants to buy nymex sep 01 at 3 . 36 and you wish to have a 1 cent margin , please enter 3 . 36 as the desired price and 0 . 01 as the margin . the system will trade the order when the enrononline offer for nymex sep 01 is at 3 . 35 , book the trade at 3 . 36 and record the 0 . 01 origination amount .
in order to be set up to use this functionality . please call the enrononline product control group .
changes to website passwords - as an added security measure , which has been requested by many customers , some new password rules have been instituted . first , the password cannot be equal to the login id . second , each user will be prompted to change his password every 90 days . these rules apply to all website passwords for both internal and external users .
please note stack manager changes will be available all traders as of monday august 20 , 2001 . the changes to the website will be rolled out to a few internal users on monday with the rest of the internal users being upgraded monday night , and external users by the end of the week . over the next couple of weeks all users will be prompted to change their website passwords .
if you have any questions regarding these changes please contact me at 713 - 853 - 1787 .

after we convene the management committee later this week , i will make a further announcement regarding the executive committee .Subject: conoco - big cowboy
darren :
i ' m not sure if you can help me with this , but i don ' t know who else to ask . for april and may , we have gas pathed on deal 133304 to conoco at the gepl big cowboy point . conoco is saying that we did not buy that gas from them . they have accounted for all of the hpl big cowboy gas and think we have over paid by about $ 1 . 5 mil each month for the gepl gas . do you know why we added the gepl meter to the deal in april ? could we have bought this gas from someone else ? i have the meter statements from tejas , but they do not say who the supply company was .

thoughts on texas a & m . . .
fox sports show host jim rome
1 ) they won ' t shut up . they have to go on about spirit , and old army , and
red ass , and how bonfire represents the burning sensation they have in
their urine to beat ut , and blah blah blah . shut up . you start to get the
feeling the entire school was built to spite ut .
2 ) forget the fact that when the texas legislature back in the 1870 ' s
passed legislation to start a state university they also decided to have a
subsidiary branch of the main school ( university of texas ) that would teach
agriculture and mechanics . aggies love to say their school is older , from
where they get that i don ' t now . . . . . . the fact is , the state intended a & m
to be a branch of ut . they are like the afterbirth fromthe original
creation . like danny devito in " twins " .
3 ) so they apparently have this complex , so much so , that they must
devote
their entire school to trying to prove to ut that they are just as good .
all the while , nobody at ut denies that a & m is a good school , yet they
won ' t shut up . so they write a fight song . . . . . . about ? . . . . texas , and how
they want to beat them . they have a fish camp for freshman where they tell
them how bad texas is and how good a & m and all its traditions are . it is
the world ' s largest known case of penis envy , and it is manifested in
everything a & m does .
4 ) the people at a & m . now we all have friends who went to a & m or are at
a & m .
there are some nice people there . however . . . there is the corp . east texas '
answer to dreams of rotc kids everywhere . for every boy scout who never
learned to stop playing with his gi joe toys , there is the corp . now ,
forget the fact that a however ,
nobody respects the corp . i imagine they are kind of the laughing stock of
the military world . just because you dress like the army , and try and act
like the army , does not make you the army . people at a & m don ' t even respect
these clowns . it is not cool to shave your head and dress up . halloween is
only supposed to be one day of the year . if you want to carry guns and beat
up civilians , move to israel .
5 ) it is even less cool to slobber on somebody ' s daughter on national
television and call it a tradition . dry humping 18 year old girls in the
stands at football games is not cool . not only is it not cool , it should be
against the law . i know that in college station , students are just prone to
mount each other on the campus lawn , or in the middle of class , or anytime
anything good happens you can just grab the girl sitting next to you and
start sucking on her face . but everywhere else in the world , it is looked
down upon . especially if you are doing it on my tv . that is why we have
moved the game from thanksgiving . because people across the nation were
gagging on their turkey when in the middle of watching a football game ,
some boy scout is tongue thrashing some overweight co - ed during somebody ' s
thanksgiving dinner . we do not need to see burly women engaged in a
suckfest every time your woeful offense manages to put points on the board .
some of these girls are in desperate need of a trip to the clinique
counter . screw that , forget make - up , it is too late for that , just give
them a veil .
6 ) " t . u . " is not funny . it is not insulting . it is dumb . just imagine if
folks from texas kept talking about m & a and giggling . that would not be
funny . in fact , it would be retarded . that ' s why ut fans don ' t do it .
please learn .
7 ) you want to lose the image of country bumpkins , of a people fond of
sheep , of people that aren ' t stupid ? then quit building things that fall
down . quit chasing cheerleaders around with swords on national tv . quit
whooping in church . quit whooping period . quit putting up scoreboards for
the enjoyment of dead mammals . quit spending your friday nights practicing
how to yell . quit telling rape jokes to reporters when you ' re running for
governor . when you are filling out season ticket renewals , and the form
asks for your phone # , h & w , quit putting 258 - 3999 , height 6 ' 3 " , weight
185 . just , collectively , stop making asses of yourselves . go to east
texas , tour every small town , and ask every red neck with a 5 th grade
education why they cheer for a & m and wear maroon . that is your fan base .
this is why you are perceived by the educated masses as stupid .
8 ) nobody cares if you think your band is better . they might be louder ,
they might march in neat little zig zags , but they have no musical ability .
the point is , nobody cares who wins halftime . quit getting geeked up about
marching bands . i find it hard to believe you stood through your high
school band ' s entire halftime performance . and why ? cause nobody cared then
and nobody cares now . plus , you can hear them fine sitting down even if you
do care . why is it cool all of a sudden now that you ' re in college ?
9 ) men should never let out high pitched whooping sounds . perhaps the
only
justifiable situation in which this can be tolerated is perhaps during an
anal probe . oh wait . . . i understand now .
10 ) dogs are not ladies . they don ' t look or smell like ladies . dogs eat
their own feces and should be treated accordingly .
11 ) finally , college station is an arm - pit of a town . quit pretending that
it is a great college town . it is a town and there is a college there . that
should be the end of this comparison . if you feel that life doesn ' t get any
better than the dixie chicken , and enjoy being stuck in a never ending
" dukes of hazard " episode , then move there . more importantly , don ' t move to
austin . . . . . they are trying to create an educated , technological , and open
minded population base . austin is , and will continue to be , the birthplace
and final resting place of all that is cool .
as my friend stephen johnson once said : " if the world were ever to get an
enema , college station is where you would connect the hose . " if you go to
school at a & m , please don ' t be an aggie .
god bless the great state of texas .

megan ,
the april and may nomination spreadsheets from producer services reflect that there were purchases from conoco on hpl . there are no references to any purchases from conoco on gepl . on june 6 , 2001 , tom acton edited deal ticket # 133304 to include gepl meter # ' s 27 - 002 - 08 and 27 - 003 - 08 . i have no idea why tom edited the deal ticket to include the gepl meters . tom is no longer at aep and i couldn ' t find any documentation to support the changes . please advise if you need additional information .

i have felt a renewed heart for god , a fresh spirit . i have been in the word lately and doug and i have to committed to prayer time together each morning . it has brought a more positive attitude , much joy , and thankfulness on my part . and , yes , satan has already tried to steal that joy . but he will not prevail , i will not let him . so in those times when i feel that any bit of joy is seeping away , i begin to pray . i found this prayer to be refreshing and worded well . please read it , it may just jumpstart your day and you ' ll be filled with joy . have a great day ! amber
please take a moment to relax your mind and
humble your heart to focus on christ .
allow god , to be the only person on your

remember jesus ' example - to
slip away and find a quiet place to pray . it ' s
the best response when i ' m
pushed beyond my limits . i know that when i can ' t
pray , you listen to my heart . continue to use me to do
your will . ? continue to bless me that i may

several changes have been made to stack manager and the website . these changes are outlined below and will be visible by all as of monday september 3 , 2001 .
stack manager changes
activate / inactivate stack - this functionality allows the trader to pull a product ' s prices from the website without suspending the product . if the top of stack limit order functionality is activated for a particular product this should be used to pull the stack prices from the website without pulling the entire product ; therefore , if there are top of stack limit orders against the product they will remain visible and transactable on the website .
if a product ' s stack is inactivated the font for that product will be grayed out in stack manager . if the stack is active it will appear in black font .
to use this feature , select the product , right click and choose " inactivate stack " . when you are ready to reactivate your prices , select the same product , right click again and choose " activate stack " . there are also icons on the tool bar at the top of your screen which will activate / inactivate the stack of the highlighted product . see screen shot below for the icons .
changes to product properties - currently when modifications are made to certain properties within the product properties screen , the product will be suspended and pulled from the website . now instead of being suspended , the product ' s stack will become inactive . once the changes have been made and saved to the properties of a product simply click the activate stack icon as discussed above .
website change
restrictions on top of stack orders - if top of stack limit orders are allowed on a product , but the trader is not showing both a bid and offer , limit orders will not be able to be placed on that product .
if you have any questions please call me at 31787 . thanks .

the following additions and modifications to stack manager will be effective as of saturday september 8 , 2001 .
stack manager modifications
inactivate all stack - in addition to the individual activate / inactive stack buttons , there is now an inactivate all stack button . similar to the suspend all button , this button will inactivate the trader ' s stack on all active products . any existing top of stack limit orders will continue to post to the website and remain transactable . see screen shot below : inactivate all stack button on far right .
please note that we have switched the positions of the suspend and inactivate buttons in stack manager .
fill order - if a product is set up as either restricted top of stack or top of stack the trader now has the ability to automatically fill any order that is at the top of the stack . in order to fill a limit order that is at the top of the product ' s stack , which will appear in pink , the trader should right click anywhere on the stack window and choose " fill order " . the volume filled on an order will be that which is offered by the trader . in order to fill the complete volume of the order , the trader will need to adjust the volume in his stack .
floated stack windows - if the stack is inactive on a product , the price and volume fields on the my products tab will continue to be blank . on the depth window and floated stack window of these products the trader ' s prices will be in gray and italics . children of products that have inactive stacks will not be gray and italicised in the floated stack windows and will not see the calculated prices .
no auto inactivate stack - it is now possible to keep a product active even if the trader is not logged into stack manager . if the trader wishes to enable this functionality on the upper right corner of the product properties page the trader should choose " no auto inactivate when stack manager is down " .
changes regarding suspension of products
stack manager will inactivate products rather than suspend them in the following cases :
? market close - if a product is active at the end of its trading hours its stack will automatically become inactive rather than suspending . in order to keep a product ' s stack active past the set trading hours , the trader should choose " keep awake " next to the trading hours section of the product properties page .
? auto suspend now inactivates stack - on a product with the auto suspend function enabled to monitor the price changes on the product , the product ' s stack will be inactivated if the suspend at level is reached . this feature can be used by checking the enable box on the product properties page under the auto suspend section .
? logging out of stack manager - when you log out of stack manager without inactivating or suspending your products , the system will now inactivate your products rather than suspending them .

james , thanks for following up on this .
fyi to all , the agreement we have with el paso has a fairly tight confidentiality provision that goes to internal ( as well as external ) communication of the transaction :
" no party shall make any announcement of the transactions contemplated hereby to any of its officers , employees , representatives , consultants or advisors other than those who have a specific and strategic need to be advised of such information , all of whom shall be advised of the strict confidential nature of such information . "
the language stems from a problem we had when east coast power was sold late last year , but probably works to our advantage in this case . suffice to say that this group needs to be plugged in on what ' s coming down the pipe . however , we need to limit discussion of the transaction to the maximum extent possible .
thanks ,

one other very important item of which you must be aware is that el paso was very concerned about the confidentiality of this transaction and insisted that our agreement contain the following provision :
" no party shall make any announcement of the transactions contemplated hereby to any of its officers , employees , representatives , consultants or advisors other than those who have a specific and strategic need to be advised of such information , all of whom shall be advised of the strict confidential nature of such information .

subject : tribute to america
subject : tribute to america
i needed to read this in light of yesterday ' s events . . . . .
tribute to the united states
this , from a canadian newspaper , is worth sharing .
america : the good neighbor .
widespread but only partial news coverage was given
recently to a remarkable editorial broadcast from
toronto by gordon sinclair , a canadian television
commentator . what follows is the full text of his
trenchant remarks as printed in the congressional
record :
" this canadian thinks it is time to speak up for the
americans as the most generous and possibly the
least appreciated people on all the earth . germany ,
japan and , to a lesser extent , britain and italy
were lifted out of the debris of war by the
americans who poured in billions of dollars and
forgave other billions in debts .
none of these countries is today paying even the
interest on its remaining debts to the united
states . when france was in danger of collapsing in
1956 , it was the americans who propped it up , and
their reward was to be insulted and swindled on the
streets of paris . i was there . i saw it .
when earthquakes hit distant cities , it is the
united states that hurries in to help . this spring ,
59 american communities were flattened by tornadoes .
nobody helped . the marshall plan and the truman
policy pumped billions of dollars into discouraged
countries . now newspapers in those countries are
writing about the decadent , warmongering americans .
i ' d like to see just one of those countries that is
gloating over the erosion of the united states
dollar build its own airplane . does any other
country in the world have a plane to equal the
boeing jumbo jet , the lockheed tri - star , or the
douglas dcl 0 ?
if so , why don ' t they fly them ? why do all the
international lines except russia fly american
planes ? why does no other land on earth even
consider putting a man or woman on the moon ? you
talk about japanese technocracy , and you get radios .
you talk about german technocracy , and you get
automobiles . you talk about american technocracy ,
and you find men on the moon - not once , but several
times - and safely home again .
you talk about scandals , and the americans put
theirs right in the store window for everybody to
look at . even their draft - dodgers are not pursued
and hounded . they are here on our streets , and most
of them , unless they are breaking canadian laws , are
getting american dollars from ma and pa at home to
spend here .
when the railways of france , germany and india were
breaking down through age , it was the americans who
rebuilt them . when the pennsylvania railroad and the
new york central went broke , nobody loaned them an
old caboose . both are still broke .
i can name you 5000 times when the americans raced
to the help of other people in trouble . can you name
me even one time when someone else raced to the
americans in trouble ? i don ' t think there was
outside help even during the san francisco
earthquake .
our neighbors have faced it alone , and i ' m one
canadian who is damned tired of hearing them get
kicked around . they will come out of this thing
with their flag high . and when they do , they are
entitled to thumb their nose at the lands that are
gloating over their present troubles . i hope canada
is not one of those . "
stand proud , america ! wear it proudly ! !
this is one of the best editorials that i have ever
read regarding the united states . it is nice that
one man realizes it . i only wish that the rest of
the world would realize it . we are always blamed for
everything , and never even get a thank you for the
things we do .
i would hope that each of you would send this to as
many people as you can and emphasize that they
should send it to as many of their friends until
this letter is sent to every person on the web . i am
just a single american that has read this , tribute to
the united states

stacy ,
could we add the following phrase ( as shown below in red ) to the exxon katy location ? this is to reassure our customers that the delivery is in fact intrastate . please let me know if this is possible to do and if we have your approval .
exxonkaty
the transaction is for delivery of intrastate gas at the tailgate of the exxon katy plant . notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the general terms and conditions , if applicable , this transaction is between counterparty and enron north america corp .

lisa ,
what is involved in changing a product description to include this phrase ? i do have some customers in texas that are legally bound to only trade intrastate gas and they are fearful of trading anything that doesn ' t specifically state that .
since it is probably only a handful of customers , if it is a major production , it may not be worth it , but i wanted to check .
thanks .

hi daren ,
bryan hull gave me your name . a customer was interested in trading intrastate gas and bryan had informed me that our exxon - katy location is intrastate . i was wondering if you would be interested in changing the long description on eol for this location to include the phrase intrastate gas so that any customers that are interested would be able to see that . if this is okay with you , i will forward it on to our product development team .
thanks .

how true - isn ' t it amazing and wonderful to see prayers in public -
congress on the capitol steps . it would be interesting to know when this
original prayer was given - i can not imagine people walking out of prayers

opening prayer - - kansas state senate

seems prayer still upsets some people .
when minister joe wright was asked to open the new
session of the kansas senate , everyone was expecting
the usual generalities , but this is what they heard :
" heavenly father , we come before you today to ask
your forgiveness and to seek your direction and
guidance .
we know your word says , " woe to those who call evil
good " , but that is exactly what we have done .
we have lost our spiritual equilibrium and reversed
our values . we confess that .
we have ridiculed the absolute truth of your word and
called it pluralism .
we have exploited the poor and called it the lottery ,
we have rewarded laziness and called it welfare ,
we have killed our unborn and called it choice ,
we have shot abortionists and called it justifiable ,
we have neglected to discipline our children and
called it building self - esteem ,
we have abused power and called it politics ,
we have coveted our neighbor ' s possessions and called
it ambition ,
we have polluted the air with profanity and
pornography and called it freedom of statement ,
we have ridiculed the time - honored values of our
forefathers and called it enlightenment .
search us , oh , god , and know our hearts today ; cleanse
us from every sin and set us free . guide and bless
these men and women who have been sent to direct us to
the center of your will and to openly ask these things
in the name of your son , the living savior , jesus
christ . " amen . ! ! "
the response was immediate . a number of legislators
walked out during the prayer in protest . in 6 short
weeks , central christian church , where rev . wright is
pastor , logged more than 5 , 000 phone calls with only
47 of those calls responding negatively . the church
is now receiving international requests for copies of
this prayer from india , africa , and korea .
commentator paul harvey aired this prayer on his radio
program , " the rest of the story " , and received a
larger response to this program than any other he has
ever aired . with the lord ' s help , may this prayer

houston regarding a five - year package of gas . i spoke to him only briefly
but did not get a good feeling about him or his deal . do you know of this
firm ? i was unable to pull up anything on the internet . i suspect he ' s
just a marketer .
don ' t spend any time on this . i was just curious as to whether or not you

stacy ,
could we add the following phrase ( as shown below in red ) to the exxon katy location ? this is to reassure our customers that the delivery is in fact intrastate . please let me know if this is possible to do and if we have your approval .
exxonkaty
the transaction is for delivery of intrastate gas at the tailgate of the exxon katy plant . notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the general terms and conditions , if applicable , this transaction is between counterparty and enron north america corp .

lisa ,
what is involved in changing a product description to include this phrase ? i do have some customers in texas that are legally bound to only trade intrastate gas and they are fearful of trading anything that doesn ' t specifically state that .
since it is probably only a handful of customers , if it is a major production , it may not be worth it , but i wanted to check .

subject : fw : crm database
as you know , much of jd , mark and my time to date has been geared around finding what companies , customers , phone numbers and past business that we may have done with the customers we started with and move forward from that starting point . in the few short weeks we have addressed , uncovered and started down the road to what i hope to be a very profitable 2001 - 2002 .
the crm database should be a great tool for those that follow . it appears that the originators would log in calls , meetings and any other business that gets discussed with the customer . this would have been a great tool for our group to have had in starting from ground zero .
there still appears to be some developmental issues around this program . in the meantime , we are using a number of spreadsheets to keep up with our business . should the crm database not be approved or delayed , we have decided to populate the act 2000 ! database . this is currently supported by enron but is not as user friendly as the crm would be . the cost for act 2000 ! is relatively free !
if you have any questions , please let me know .

subject : crm database
on thursday of this past week i went to a meeting regarding the crm database which is designed by siebel for the purpose of handling customer information .
the crm database has only been implemented with trading / origination groups within enron and provides the following capabilities :
1 . account & contact management
2 . activity tracking & planning
3 . potential deal management
4 . outlook synchronization
5 . remote connectivity / synchronization
6 . e - mail from siebel and records activity
the current enron groups that use this system are the enron industrial markets that was implemented in may 2001 and the freight markets that was implemented in august 2001 . the following is a list of how these groups have been utilizing the system :
industrial mkts freight mkts
users 175 45
counterparties 8 , 200 20 , 000
contacts 14 , 000 20 , 000
activities 1 , 200 900
quotes 150
opportunities 361 11
the following groups have also inquired about this system and having it implemented :
eol
global mkts
ees
transportation
east power orig
insolvent debt
some of the basic costs and timeline for this system are $ 120 - $ 150 , 000 for 20 - 30 users with a 5 week timeline for implementation . this is a basic implementation that may not include all of the functionality shown above ( i . e . , no remote connectivity ) .
the reason that i have written this is to show a possible system that could be used by the gas floor origination and trading groups to manage contact information and share data among groups . the cost to implement this for all of the origination groups does not appear to be prohibitive and it could be implemented in a good time frame . some of the issues are coordination among the groups and the desire to share information . let me know if you think this is a viable possibility and what would be the best way to approach the other origination groups .
colin tonks , database / system guy , within the fundamentals group was also at the meeting and thinks this would work great . he would be the individual coordinating efforts from the natural gas system side .

affiliates

breaking news : posted sep 26 , 4 : 16 pm
proposed rule extends marketing affiliate regulations to all affiliates
federal energy regulatory commissioners wednesday agreed to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking broadening the application of standards of conduct for transmission providers , including both natural gas pipelines and power lines , to require separation of the regulated monopolies from any other company affiliate .
previously , the rules simply required creation of a firewall , including separate operations in separate locations staffed by separate personnel , between gas pipelines and their marketing affiliates . the proposed rule would wall off both gas and electric transmission operations from any other affiliate , gas or electric , including financial affiliates .
the commission was presented with two options regarding the application of the proposed rule to electric transmission affiliates , which still in many cases have bundled operations . one option would enforce complete separation , while a second would have exempted employees who deal in sales or purchases of bundled retail native load . staff and commissioners wood , william massey and nora brownell appeared to favor walling off all affiliated personnel , so they would not be privy to market information about transmission operations that other non - affiliated competitors did not have access to .
commissioner linda breathitt , however , argued for exempting personnel dealing solely with retail native load . breathitt said that while she supported the eventual separation of the entities , she was concerned about the timing . " i see no compelling reason at this time ; there have been no complaints and no evidence . " she said she thought state commissions might consider the move an infringement on their jurisdiction . " i agree with concept philosophically , but i think there will be other opportunities later on , after we do a little more bridge - building with state commissions . "
wood said he understood " the political issue here with respect to federal - state relations , but i think this is an opportunity for discrimination that ought to be eliminated . " staff pointed out that if there were any problems with transmission reliability or if some small utilities had problems , waivers could be granted . staff was questioned by the commissioners as to how much information was available to affiliate personnel . " if i am an affiliate employee dealing solely with retail native load , i can go into the control room and get all the information i want , " one staffer responded .
wood proposed , and the commissioners ratified , a proposed rule with no exceptions , but which makes clear that in the final rule the commission may reverse field and determine that separation of employees dealing with sales of native load is not required . commenting parties should provide cost / benefit analysis on both sides of the question . state commissions are also invited to comment . wood had suggested the commission extend the separation to all sales employees , " but make it clear that if we don ' t hear from people that they really want this separation , we ain ' t going to do it .

there is no way to undermine the devastation and loss we ' ve all
witnessed and felt over the last couple of weeks , but when you look at the
following numbers and realize how much worse it could ' ve been , i guess there
are a lot of people who were saved . . .
subject : the odds are against them
by now everyone has been hearing the death toll rise
and reports of the
destruction from the terrorist attacks on the us .
these were deplorable
acts
that we will never forget . but now is a time to look
at the other side of
the
numbers coming out of new york , washington and
pennsylvania . the sad
but somewhat uplifting side that the mainstream
media has not reported yet
- the survival rates and some positive news about
the attacks .
* * * the buildings * * *
* the world trade center -
the twin towers of the world trade center were
places of employment for
some
50 , 000 people . with the missing list of just over
5 , 000 people , that means
90 % of the people targeted survived the attack . a
90 % on a test is an ' a ' .
* the pentagon -
some 23 , 000 people were the target of a third plane
aimed at the pentagon .
the latest count shows that only 123 lost their
lives . that is an amazing
99 . 5 % survival rate . in addition , the plane seems to
have come in too low ,
too early to affect a large portion of the building .
on top of that , the
section that was hit was the first of five sections
to undergo renovations
that would help protect the pentagon from terrorist
attacks . it had
recently
completed straightening and blastproofing , saving
untold lives . this attack
was sad , but a statistical failure .
* * * the planes * * *
* american airlines flight 77
this boeing 757 that was flown into the outside of
the pentagon could have
carried up to 289 people , yet only 64 were aboard .
luckily 78 % of the seats
were empty .
* american airlines flight 11
this boeing 767 could have had up to 351 people
aboard , but only carried
92 .
thankfully 74 % of the seats were unfilled .
* united airlines flight 175
another boeing 767 that could have sat 351 people
only had 65 people on
board . fortunately it was 81 % empty .
* united airlines flight 93
this boeing 757 was one of the most uplifting
stories yet . the smallest
flight to be hijacked with only 45 people aboard out
of a possible 289 had
84 % of its capacity unused . yet these people stood
up to the attackers and
thwarted a fourth attempted destruction of a
national landmark , saving
untold numbers of lives in the process .
* * * in summary * * *
out of potentially 74 , 280 americans directly
targeted by these inept
cowards , 93 % survived or avoided the attacks . that ' s
a higher survival rate
than heart attacks , breast cancer , kidney
transplants and liver transplants
- all common , survivable illnesses .
the hijacked planes were mostly empty , the pentagon
was hit at it ' s
strongest point , the overwhelming majority of people
in the world trade
center buildings escaped , and a handful of
passengers gave the ultimate
sacrifice to save even more lives .
pass this information on to those in fear and the
media . don ' t fear these
terrorists . the odds are against them .

brian ,
i have forwarded your e - mail to the people in our shop that will be working
most directly on this project . tom hodges has talked with kerry puckett in
our bd group . they have set a meeting up for tues . 10 / 02 / 01 . we can setup
a confidentiality agreement if you want , that would probably allow us to
discuss storage options in the area more freely . since you are out today
i ' ll see if i can ' t get rick moncrief to send over a form of agreement we
have used , they all look pretty similar . as far as deal structure i ' m
pretty open on how we setup , but am definitely interested in equity
partnership / jv . as this is our core area of assets we wish to continue to
be actively involved in deals that we believe add value .
i believe there is significant potential to create a trading platform
utilizing our combined assets as well as the liquidity sres ' s system supply
could create at an expanded waha hub .
rick ' s group will be taking the point on this project and will coordinate
others involvement as necessary within our company .
we look forward to working with you and your team on this project .
thanks

mitch :
a lot has happened since we last met - but i wanted to get back to you
on our waha hubco project . i have attached an initial presentation on
the topic and have asked our engineers ( dave owen and tom hodge ) to get
in touch with brad to look at the physical interconnection options . we
are doing the same with tw and it would be good to understand more about
your system and your objectives . i would also like to understand your
thoughts on the commercial structure and terms you would ( or would not )
like to work with enron on this .
i suggest a confidentiality agreement would be appropriate as a starting
point and if you like i can forward one for your review .

brian

subject : path manager rewrite / optimization project
importance : high
all :
we ' re currently identifying processes that are inefficient and could possibly benefit from being rewritten or not even performed . going foward , i would like bob to appoint a lead business person to whom we could ask questions and or suggest ideas to so that they could in turn validate this information with the desk managers / schedulers . we had this approach with nomlogic and having clarissa work the issues worked quite nicely . who ever you choose , we would need about 15 % of their time for now . later on , with coordination efforts and testing , it may go up to 75 % . i don ' t see that happening for a while though .
the sooner we get someone to devote to this , the better off we will be . i expect these changes that we ' ll be looking into should improve performance quite a bit .
that being said , we ' ve identified three items that would speed up processing the retrieval of path manager .
1 ) currently , the path manager attempts to reuse path ids . i can ' t think of any reason why we need to perform this extra step ? it runs through this processing on the application and generally doesn ' t find a match . i know patti has mentioned this several times and i can ' t think of a valid reason for performing this work . i talked with dave nommensen , and according to him , what used to happen is that sometimes schedulers would get duplicate paths out there which is why they put this code in place ? ? ? from a scheduling perspective , my understanding of what your main concern is to just maintain your position and be able to change it . if you were overpathed , you ' d see it in the path manager either way . [ pinion , richard ] to restate the question for clarity , in path manager a scheduler pulls down a supply , market and a service , adds any up / downstream contract information and / or duns or drn override and then saves it . unify looks for an old path with those exact variables and if it finds it re - uses it and if it does not find an exact match creates a new path and path id . i had been told that to do away with this function would create an unacceptably high amount of paths since any path once nominated on could not be deleted . has this changed ? ? ? at one time there were some schedulers that looked for the same path / activity number match for nominations . texas eastern was the only pipeline that needed the old activity numbers no matter how long it had been since they were used . i spoke with chris ordway and the new link system no longer needs this to occur . transco uses activity numbers but uses the activity number cross reference table to that function and therefore should not be affected . therefore , if it does not create a space or memory problem for unify , i don ' t think that this constant old path look up is needed . [ kinsey , lisa ] get rid of this .
2 ) the scheduling position window : does anyone use this ? if not , we ' ll remove the code logic that populates this window . i have never seen a scheduler use this . please verify . [ pinion , richard ] originally such a window was in use by everyone in the legacy system " autonoms " so it was duplicated in unify by request . it is not used in unify now because of the other sophisticated tools unify provides which obviate it ' s use . the only value would be notification of bridge errors or contract imbalances but there are other ways to determine those problems . as voted on in a previous meeting of the managers - lose it ! [ kinsey , lisa ] why is this still here ?
3 ) on the inventory pool list , does anyone need to see the contarct references list ? again , this code is called every retrieval time and doesn ' t appear to be used from my observations . if they do need this information , we could provide it , but if not , i ' d prefer to remove the functionality . [ pinion , richard ] this function is still very much in use by those with point based pipelines that must use the imbalance pool to facilitate balancing nomination volumes where multiple pipeline external pools exist and are pathed through the same contract imbalance pool . keep it ! [ kinsey , lisa ] yes . we use this functionality a lot when pathing pools .
4 ) when pathing a one to many or many to one set of paths , what ' s the average number of paths they create at one time ? what about updates ? i know that anr and nigas are big users of this feature since they have small packages of gas that they are limited in size to . does the system seem faster when you update one record at a time or chunks of records ? my real question is how often they do this and for what number of paths on both updates and inserts . by update , i mean , going to the path list and changing an upstream / downstream contract or a psna which in turn forces a new path to be created . [ pinion , richard ] this one to many or many to one pathing goes on every day on every pipeline . there is no ' average ' . they typically update a path with up / downstream meters or duns or dnb numbers one at a time however . i hope this answers your question . i see no change to this process at this time [ kinsey , lisa ] on some pipes this function is used more than others . when it is used we try and do as many paths as possible . at this time i do not see a need to change this process .
5 ) on brokered paths , do you want to utilize the same logic we have for service ? in other words , when updating brokered arrangements , we don ' t incorporate the same logic for zeroing out the path and recreating a new arrangment link and hence sending it to be renominated ? why do we do this for service ? is it because we have to renominate it ? i assume that ' s what it ' s for since we don ' t send brokered paths to the pipe . anyway , with the nomlogic implmentation ( two way interface ) , we were planning on having it behave the same way as service . we need this verified . [ pinion , richard ] we don ' t perform the same logic for brokered paths because these are not nominated to the pipeline and hence do not need a zero path to be resent to the pipeline when a significant change is made to the already nominated path . i don ' t see a need to change the way brokered paths are behaving at this time . [ kinsey , lisa ] agree with richard .Subject: re : list of critical notices for future fundy ' s page

since lisa used fuchsia , i ' ll use lavender . .
on # 1 i would eliminate that processing . in addition , can we delete / hide / not access old paths that haven ' t been used in gas production in lets say a year or so . would this help performance ? this would also force the schedulers to path / think about the way they are pathing their transactions and not rely on old paths that may no longer be accurate ! ! we ' ve seen old bad , zero paths be re - used accidentally .
on # 2 , the scheduling position window is the weakest link . . . . . goodbye !
on # 3 , contract reference i know is used alot in the supply and market list . nomlogic is also slated to use these contract reference fields for comments . do we need it in the inventory list ? probably not as much as the supply and market list but i still believe it ' s necessary for pools and imbalance accounts .
on # 4 , we use this functionality alot on cgas , tenn , trco and sab . . . when we path one to many or many to one in " chunks , " it does seem to go faster than one path at a time .
on # 5 , brokered paths could really just be slammed in there . no need for the extra processing that occurs for service contracts .

2 ) the scheduling position window : does anyone use this ? if not , we ' ll remove the code logic that populates this window . i have never seen a scheduler use this . please verify . [ pinion , richard ] originally such a window was in use by everyone in the legacy system " autonoms " so it was duplicated in unify by request . it is not used in unify now because of the other sophisticated tools unify provides which obviate it ' s use . the only value would be notification of bridge errors or contract imbalances but there are other ways to determine those problems . as voted on in a previous meeting of the managers - lose it ! [ kinsey , lisa ] why is this still here ?
3 ) on the inventory pool list , does anyone need to see the contarct references list ? again , this code is called every retrieval time and doesn ' t appear to be used from my observations . if they do need this information , we could provide it , but if not , i ' d prefer to remove the functionality . [ pinion , richard ] this function is still very much in use by those with point based pipelines that must use the imbalance pool to facilitate balancing nomination volumes where multiple pipeline external pools exist and are pathed through the same contract imbalance pool . keep it ! [ kinsey , lisa ] yes . we use this functionality a lot when pathing pools .
4 ) when pathing a one to many or many to one set of paths , what ' s the average number of paths they create at one time ? what about updates ? i know that anr and nigas are big users of this feature since they have small packages of gas that they are limited in size to . does the system seem faster when you update one record at a time or chunks of records ? my real question is how often they do this and for what number of paths on both updates and inserts . by update , i mean , going to the path list and changing an upstream / downstream contract or a psna which in turn forces a new path to be created . [ pinion , richard ] this one to many or many to one pathing goes on every day on every pipeline . there is no ' average ' . they typically update a path with up / downstream meters or duns or dnb numbers one at a time however . i hope this answers your question . i see no change to this process at this time [ kinsey , lisa ] on some pipes this function is used more than others . when it is used we try and do as many paths as possible . at this time i do not see a need to change this process .
5 ) on brokered paths , do you want to utilize the same logic we have for service ? in other words , when updating brokered arrangements , we don ' t incorporate the same logic for zeroing out the path and recreating a new arrangment link and hence sending it to be renominated ? why do we do this for service ? is it because we have to renominate it ? i assume that ' s what it ' s for since we don ' t send brokered paths to the pipe . anyway , with the nomlogic implmentation ( two way interface ) , we were planning on having it behave the same way as service . we need this verified . [ pinion , richard ] we don ' t perform the same logic for brokered paths because these are not nominated to the pipeline and hence do not need a zero path to be resent to the pipeline when a significant change is made to the already nominated path . i don ' t see a need to change the way brokered paths are behaving at this time . [ kinsey , lisa ] agree with richard .Subject: tenaska iv

yes , you are correct . when we watchdog , we ' ll most likely do vm and settlements and not pm . but , in the afternoon , if they need payments out the door , pm will get it . it goes both ways . so , if you send me who needs to be in the system no matter what , that would help .
you are correct , 8 - 12 is logistics critical , and after that it ' s anyones guess .

based on victor ' s response , i think there is some confusion . there are actually several critical time periods depending on the group and time of day . perhaps to eliminate the confusion you could specify which time period you are going to watchdog . i interpreted it to mean the 8 - 12 am period but victor was thinking the afternoon . depending on the time there might be different people who should be kicked out .

going forward , as a precautionary measure , we will begin locking users out of the system if the need arises . we will use our watchdog application in order to initiate this process . we will do so only as a last resort and will notify you that we will be doing this . our reasons for doing this are mainly to ensure the critical system resources are provided to the users that need them the most .
the old list we had from sybase no longer exists . i need your help in putting together a new list . please provide the list of people who are absolutely critical users that have to be on the system . obviously , the situation isn ' t remedied if everyone is an exception user : )
please provide user name and application they need ( i . e . volume management , settlements , path manager ) .
the sooner i get this , the sooner we can get this implemented .

ngi ' s daily gas price index
published : october 17 , 2001
ferc issues nopr on intra - day recalls of released capacity
given the inability of the natural gas standards - setting organization to resolve the issue of intra - day recalls of released transportation capacity , ferc has issued a notice of proposed rulemaking ( nopr ) that would give releasing shippers the flexibility to re - nominate their recalled capacity at the next scheduling opportunity provided by an interstate pipeline .
existing gas industry standards board ( gisb ) standards require a shipper that wants to re - nominate recalled capacity to notify its transportation provider by no later than 8 a . m . central clock time ( cct ) on a nomination day at the latest , and bars partial - day recalls of capacity . ferc proposes to allow shippers to recall capacity and re - nominate the recalled capacity at each of the three intra - day nomination opportunities .
" by enabling releasing shippers to recall and renominate capacity quickly , they will have greater incentive to release capacity , providing capacity purchasers with an alternative to purchasing pipeline interruptible service . at the same time , this proposal will provide replacement shippers whose capacity is recalled with the same advance notice and protection from bumping as is provided to interruptible shippers under the commission ' s regulations , " the nopr said [ rm 96 - 1 - 019 ] .
existing gisb standards applying to capacity - release recalls were adopted in 1996 , when there was only one nomination per day at 11 : 30 a . m cct and a single non - standardized intra - day nomination , it noted . " but the circumstances under which the recall standards were developed have markedly changed as the number of nomination opportunities have now expanded to four nomination opportunities . "
given the lack of " consensus supporting " gisb ' s existing recall standards and the standards - setting group ' s failure to settle the issue , the commission is forced to " resolve the policy question regarding partial - day recalls , " the nopr said . permitting partial - day recalls of released capacity , the commission concluded , was in keeping with the overall regulatory changes that it enacted in order 637 .
the natural gas supply association ( ngsa ) , which represents major producers , and houston - based dynegy let ferc know that they weren ' t big fans of partial - day recalls . these could undermine system reliability , they contend , by shutting in production and increasing scheduling problems , overruns , penalties or operational flow orders .
but the commission discounted these arguments . " . . . [ t ] he use of partial - day recalls should create no additional scheduling problems since recalls will be scheduled according to the existing scheduling requirements . in effect , releasing shippers using partial - day recalls are creating another form of interruptible transportation to compete with pipeline interruptible capacity , and shippers purchasing recallable capacity should be subject to the same scheduling rules that apply to interruptible transportation . partial - day recalls will be no more likely to result in shut - in production than interruptible transactions that are subject to being bumped under the current standards , " the nopr noted .Subject: blue dolpin / august and september 2001

enron global technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non - standard internet email address formats . the only internet email address format that will be supported , once this effort is completed , is firstname . lastname @ enron . com . we will no longer support internet email address formats such as name @ enron . com , name @ ect . enron . com , name @ ei . enron . com ( where " name " is an abbreviation , acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and / or lastname ) . every enron employee has an internet email address of firstname . lastname @ enron . com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this internet address format if they are not using it already .
any new / existing application systems or business cards that reference a non - supported internet email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname . lastname @ enron . com internet address format . it is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending internet email to any non - supported internet email addresses .
to determine what your supported internet email address is , take your name as it appears in outlook or lotus notes and replace any " spaces " that appear in your name with periods and append @ enron . com . for example in outlook , alan smith , robert ( firstname = robert , lastname = alan smith ) will have a supported internet email address of robert . alan . smith @ enron . com .
important : if you need to update your business card ( s ) to reflect your supported internet email address , please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards . if you experience any issues with delivery of internet email to your supported internet email address , please contact the resolution center .
we will communicate further details , including the cut - off date , in the coming weeks . meanwhile , it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname . lastname @ enron . com internet email address format . if you have questions regarding this email , send an email to enron . messaging . administration @ enron . com .

mike ,
as you may recall , this meter needs to be set up for may 2001 just as it was for april 2001 . below is a screen print of what april 2001 looks like . when you had previously attempted to set this meter up , i believe it wouldn ' t let you because of one ( or both ? ) of the contracts being canceled or expired . i have inquired as to what can be done and have learned that you can contact global counterparties and have them temporarily set the contract ( s ) back up for a short period to give us time run the volumes through the system . as i am unfamiliar with this process and the global counterparty personnel , i do not have a contact for you . hopefully this is something you may have had to do in the past . since this is a call - out meter , i can enter the actual volumes in once the contracts are set up and appear for may 2001 . in case you need to enter them , the volume should be as follows :
contract 012 - 41500 - 05 - 002 hpl injection 16 , 149
contract 012 - 88494 - 05 - 001 tx genl land withdrawal 16 , 149
i have been advised that this volume needs to be entered by the end of october if at all possible , therefore , your prompt attention to this matter would be most appreciated . if you have any questions , please don ' t hesitate to give me a call .

subject : filling vacancies and adding head count
after my recent budgeting experience , i think we need to tighten up our procedures around filling vacancies and adding head count .
when filling vacancies , i would like to have each of you review the positions . i think we need to challenge ourselves and the managers
to be as conservative as possible . i would like to sign off on all replacements . i promise not to be difficult .
when adding personnel over your current budgeted number , besides having the commercial team sign - off on the addition , i am think
that it may have to be approved by the coo of americas ( louise ) . i am planning on meeting with her next week to discuss in detail
how to keep her in the loop in new hires resulting from business changes ( asset management deals or service arrangements )
let me know what you think .
thanks

instead of going to the haunted house , we decided to do something where
everyone could be involved . the weather is going to nice and cool , so the
plan is to have a fire , eat and then play " capture the flag " . we will
divide into two teams and then each team hides their opponents flag
somewhere on their side . the goal of the game is to find your team ' s flag
and bring it safely back to your side . of course , it will be dark and you
have to be sneaky , because if you get caught on your opponent ' s side , then
you have to wait until you are freed . it is a very fun game , but even more
entertaining will be to see different sides of people ' s personalities . if
you aren ' t up to playing the game , then please feel free to hang out around
the fire and just yack for hours .

subject : sitara eol bridge problem today
the problem we faced today was due to 2 eol deal packets ( 2098073 , 2099764 ) not having startdate and enddate . missing these 2 tibco message fields caused the bridge to bounce and resulted in the queue to build up while the bridge is starting up . ( the bridge takes 2 minute for startup ) . each time these deals are sent / resent , it continuously cause the sitarar eolbridge to restart , thus magnifying the buildup of the queue .
the corrective action we are taking at our end is to build a rejection logic when eol packets do not have start and / or enddate .

ngi ' s daily gas price index
published : october 26 , 2001
enbridge buys koch ' s east texas midstream assets for $ 231 m
enbridge energy partners lp is buying gas gathering , treating , processing and transmission assets in east texas from koch midstream services for $ 230 . 5 million . the package includes all of the east texas system , which gathers 400 mmcf / d for delivery into the carthage hub .
enbridge energy company president dan c . tutcher said the assets are a " natural fit " with enbridge ' s existing texas assets and will significantly expand the company ' s " geographic footprint " in the region as well as its energy commodity mix . " we expect the acquisition to be immediately accretive to the partnership ' s distributable cash flow , and excellent prospects exist for further organic growth of the east texas system . ' '
enbridge partners will acquire 1 , 880 miles of various diameter gathering lines , 37 compressor stations , four gas treating plants with a capacity of 595 mmcf / d and three gas processing plants with a combined capacity of 375 mmcf / d . the transaction is anticipated to close in december .
the intrastate system derives revenues from the purchase , transportation and resale of natural gas . additionally , when natural gas liquids fractionation spreads are positive , the option exists to extract ngls from purchased gas , thus leveraging income with incremental processing revenue , the company noted . the partnership expects that the direct commodity price exposures inherent in gas purchase and resale activities and in gas processing will be suitably mitigated through a hedging strategy .
it forecasts gas supply available to the system will be 400 - 420 mmcf / d in 2002 . based on this estimate , the acquisition would contribute incremental ebitda of between $ 26 million and $ 32 million for the year , while distributable cash flow would increase by between $ 0 . 10 and $ 0 . 15 per unit , with further improvements anticipated in 2003 . the forecasts assume that acquisition financing will consist of 50 % debt and 50 % equity , in line with enbridge partners target long - term capital structure .
enbridge partners also reported third quarter net income of $ 6 . 6 million , or $ 0 . 13 per common unit , compared with net income of $ 14 . 2 million , or $ 0 . 42 per unit , for the third quarter in 2000 . the decline was attributed mainly to an adjustment to oil inventory due to shippers of $ 5 . 4 million . the adjustment was the result of what enbridge said were refinements in the oil loss estimation process , as well as improvements in the accuracy of measuring oil losses while developing new software applications .
third quarter deliveries were 1 , 208 million b / d compared to 1 , 272 mmb / d for the same period in the prior year . the partnership expects that deliveries will increase over the remainder of the year , to average between 1 . 30 and 1 . 33 mmb / d . however , its delivery estimates for 2001 and 2002 are down from prior expectations because of lower production forecasts for conventional heavy crude oil , which stem from the current wide price differential between heavy and light crude . for 2002 , growing oil sands production is anticipated to boost full - year average deliveries to between 1 . 35 and 1 . 43 mmb / d .
" the partnership ' s forecast indicates that crude oil delivery volumes , which have languished for the past several quarters , will start to improve modestly in the near term with more significant increases occurring in the latter half of 2002 , " said tutcher . " the major contributing factor will be increased production from the immense oil sands reserves in western canada . we also anticipate further successes from our acquisition strategy , which will increase earnings and diversify our sources of income . the partnership ' s primary objective over the next two to three years is to accelerate the growth of cash distributions to unitholders . to that end , we are confident that the acquisition of the east texas facilities combined with some improvement in liquid hydrocarbon deliveries will position the partnership to consider a distribution increase in 2002 .

subject : re : tglo status
megan
as i mentioned to you yesterday , it still looks like the volumes for gas delivered to tx glo do not have linda robert ' s origination fee deducted . do we need to execute a pma with txglo to deduct those volumes from the next delievery ?
also isn ' t there an entry that is missing in your file to capture the $ cost of gas for the gas delivered to txglo ? is that being captured in unify or is it being manually entered by gas accounting ?
darren
do we need to execute a seperate deal ticket for the origination deduct ?

eric :
i reviewed the gas deals on franks ' spreadsheet and they agree with what is in sitara . as soon as i have the october gas numbers , i will forward them to you .
attached is a spreadsheet of the tglo deals booked to the gl to help you with our current settlement position . it is divided by debit / credit entries . when the sales are booked , a debit hits the customer account to create the open sale to apply the cash to and a credit hits the revenue account ( 40004000 third party ; 40005000 intercompany ) for the profit center .
below is a summary of where we are on the sale dollars to egm . i have already sent an email to risk to update the demand fees for the prior months and to book aug and sept crude . i will wait for the go ahead from frank before i final them to the gl . let me know if you have any questions .

>Subject: hplc - four square 5 / 01
darren :
i have another hplc issue . . . i received an invoice from four square gas company today for may 2001 gas that was never paid . they have invoiced 1 , 654 at 4 . 825 ( hsc - . 085 ) at meter 986887 . i did not see a deal in unify , so i went to pops to find the meter . i found that the gas was pathed to the strangers gas contract . historically , hplc has always purchased the gas at this meter from four square , but it doesn ' t look like a deal was ever entered for may . the april deal number was 695469 . did hplc purchase this gas in may ?
meganSubject: hplc / tglo deals
darren :
i have a request from jim coffey that i hope you can help me with . he wants to know the cost of supplying the gas to the glo . i can follow the ena deals in path manager , but i am having a hard time with the hplc deals . it looks like we were using gas from the 215 contract . i can ' t tell , though , how the gas got to the 215 . can you tell me where we got the supply for hplc to sell and at what price ? i need to know for jan through may . the glo deal numbers are below , if you need them .

daren ,
yes , the gas on deal 210722 is going to reliant , however , it needs to be brokered instead of service as tejas does not show any transport . i don ' t know if it can be changed or if a new deal needs to be set up .
thanks ,

daren ,
sherlyn schumack suggested that i contact you with this matter . i am working on some old hpl issues and have come across a deal that was initially set up , # 208101 , but this deal was subsequently killed ( no reason found ) . this deal was copied from # 205533 which was good through 2 / 29 / 00 . please set up a valid deal for march 2000 just like either one of these deals whereby hpl is buying gas from ena on tejas at the same points . this deal is needed because it leads to a valid sale to reliant energy . please note that reliant has been invoiced and settlement has already been made .
if i have not provided enough information or if you have any questions , please do not hesitate to give me a call . as i need to resolve this issue as soon as possible , your prompt attention to this matter would be most appreciated .

subject : ena origination track
all ,
ena is building an ena origination track similar to that of the trading track . originators on both the gas & power side at the vp level have bought into the development of this program . the management of the program will be the originators themselves under louise kitchen . there will be structured rotations for the analysts & associates who join this program with a clear objective in mind - final rotation will be in origination .
the below people , according to our records , are currently in your groups . these candidates have been identified as they have completed at least one relevant rotation and / or have performed well in the previous prc . prior to contacting the below analysts & associates , i want to ensure your buy - in / recommendation of these candidates . all selected candidates would be formally interviewed by the origination management team ( both gas & power ) prior to joining the program .
i would be grateful for your early response as we are looking to schedule a date in november to commence interviews .
if you have any questions , please let me know and i will be happy to explain the program in greater detail .
kind regards ,
karen

Subject: sec information / earnings restatement
today we released additional information about our related party and off - balance sheet transactions . we have made this information available both on our website and in a form 8 - k filing with the securities and exchange commission ( sec ) .
the information provides further details about :
- - the $ 1 . 2 billion charge to shareholders ' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge ;
- - a restatement of prior years ' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders ' equity , the consolidation of three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications ;
- - the special committee appointed by the enron board of directors to review transactions between enron and related parties ;
- - the ljm limited partnerships , including a discussion of transactions between enron and ljm entities ; and
- - transactions between enron and other enron employees .
this information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the sec . as our board ' s new special committee continues its review of various matters , we will continue to cooperate fully with the sec in its investigation , and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate , appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses .
restatement of earnings
based on information that we have recently obtained , enron and its auditors determined that certain off - balance sheet entities should have been included in enron ' s consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles . as a result , enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001 . these restatements have no material effect on enron ' s current financial position . here are some details included in the filing :
net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of joint energy development investments ( jedi ) and chewco beginning in november 1997 , the consolidation of an ljml subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments . enron ' s current assessment indicates that the restatement will include :
- - a reduction of approximately $ 96 million in 1997
- - a reduction of approximately $ 113 million in 1998
- - a reduction of approximately $ 250 million in 1999
- - a reduction of approximately $ 132 million in 2000
- - an increase of approximately $ 17 million for the first quarter of 2001
- - an increase of approximately $ 5 million for the second quarter of 2001
- - a reduction of $ 17 million for the third quarter of 2001 .
the consolidation of jedi and chewco also will increase enron ' s debt by approximately $ 711 million in 1997 , $ 561 million in 1998 , $ 685 million in 1999 and $ 628 million in 2000 .
the restatement will have no material impact on enron ' s reported earnings for the nine - month period ending september 2001 .
you can obtain more detailed information on the items described above by accessing the form 8 - k filing at .
we will continue to review our strategic , operational and financial position , and we will continue to keep you updated on any developments .Subject: enron announces plans to merge with dynegy
today , we announced plans to merge with dynegy , a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties . dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own . we believe merging with dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you ' ve worked so hard to build . following are the major components of the transaction .
deal terms
- - the transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0 . 2685 dynegy shares for every enron share . for example , each 1 , 000 shares of enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of dynegy upon closing , plus cash for fractional shares , upon closing .
- - chevrontexaco owns approximately 26 percent of dynegy ' s outstanding common stock . chevrontexaco will invest $ 1 . 5 billion in dynegy immediately and an additional $ 1 billion in dynegy on closing of the merger . dynegy will immediately invest $ 1 . 5 billion in cash in enron ' s northern natural gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in northern natural gas .
- - total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares .
- - the transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals , and is expected to close late next year .
enron will have immediate access to dynegy ' s $ 1 . 5 billion cash investment in enron ' s northern natural gas subsidiary .
management of newly formed company
chuck watson will be chairman and ceo of the newly formed company , which will be called dynegy inc . , and steve bergstrom will be president and coo .
i will continue to serve as chairman and ceo of enron until the transaction closes . i will not join the dynegy office of the chairman . greg whalley will continue to serve as president and coo of enron until the transaction closes . then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the dynegy office of the chairman . mark frevert will continue as vice chairman of enron .
management from enron and dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth , efficient integration . the make - up of the integration team has not yet been determined .
the merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002 . this merger will create an enormous growth engine , providing great opportunities for our employees , shareholders and customers . as with any merger , some elimination of positions is almost inevitable , and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company . we hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions . clearly , we cannot rule out involuntary separation , but dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations . i promise you that i will do everything i can to make this transition as smooth as possible .
as i said in my video , this is a day like no other in our company ' s history . we considered several options , but we believe that this merger with dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence , strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses .
i know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps . we have a list of frequently asked questions posted at . if you have additional questions , please submit them to questions @ enron . com . we will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions . if you receive any calls from the media , please refer them to our media team at ( 713 ) 853 - 5670 .
i ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company . rather than closing doors , we are opening new ones , as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise , including our market reach , financial strength and industry experience . together , we will be a new merchant powerhouse .
and again , thank you for everything you have done for enron .
investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement / prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available , because it will contain important information . investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement / prospectus ( when it is available ) and other documents containing information about dynegy and enron , without charge , at the sec ' s web site at www . sec . gov . copies of the joint proxy statement / prospectus and the sec filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement / prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either : investor relations , dynegy inc . , 1000 louisiana , suite 5800 , houston , tx 77002 , phone : ( 713 ) 507 - 6400 , fax : ( 713 ) 507 - 6808 ; or investor relations , enron corp . , 1400 smith street , houston , tx 77002 , phone : ( 713 ) 853 - 3956 , fax : ( 713 ) 646 - 3002 .

i have no problem sticking around with the group , it is a compliment and i am glad that you all appreciate what i have been able to contribute to the group . i just want your opinion on something .
one of my many goals while a part of the analyst program is to become a senior analyst or third year analyst . it is a promotion that also brings with it a bit of a pay increase . in no way do i want to imply greed , or that i will only stay for money , but if in your opinion i may be deserving of this , then maybe we could run it by bob or the program , or whoever is in control of that .
just a thought , let me know what you think .

as many of you know , i have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $ 20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of enron . the merger with dynegy , or a similar transaction with any other company , would trigger this provision on closing . assuming the merger with dynegy is closed within 6 - 9 months , as we expect , this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $ 60 million .
many ceos have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989 . but given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees , i have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment . initially , i thought i would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash . however , after talking to a number of employees this afternoon , i have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment . therefore , at closing , i will receive no payments under this provision .
i know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face . but please know that i will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of enron ' s employees and shareholders . i am still very proud of what we have built at enron , and i want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore enron to its rightful place in the energy industry .

matt / ben :
i am responding to your request for comments on revising path manager by expanding the parameters of the path termination process to include zero volume paths on the last day of the month as a way to speed up unify response and retrieve times .
based on my interviews of various desks including aep and calgary and our recent discussions , we find a legitimate business need to allow zero volume paths to roll from month to month ( requirements contracts on wellhead gas ) . following is a recap of what is proposed to be done regarding zero path termination .
1 . all paths that are zero on the last day of a month ( exception noted in # 2 below ) will terminate on that day and will no longer roll into the following month .
this path termination out function will run every night . any paths changed to zero retroactively will zero out future month ' s paths unless a volume
is on that path in the future month .
2 . zero paths marked as " always send nominations " will continue to roll from month to month until changed to some other nomination option . it appears that hpl
( 736 paths ) and nigas ( 1136 paths ) might have some paths rolling that no longer need to . a special one time handling of these paths will be coordinated with the
scheduler when you are ready .
3 . zero paths which roll from month to month using the " volume management - do not send " function will cease to do so . this was agree to by patti in regards to
paths for oba tracking .
all :
please respond via e - mail with any comments .

they had balances in it .
i also spoke to jim tobacco at epgt for at least an hour or so , going over every line item which was rejected , please get with me once you are back in the office
and i will go over the " correct " pathing procedures .
i met with richard and reviewed november transactions for epgt to determine if we could eliminate the external pools but unfortunately we cannot do this .
if we transport then we must use the external pool . however , you do not need to use internal pools but must use the imbalance pools which you are currently
using , therefore , i have terminated the internal pools .

daren ,
i am trying to get some payments out to williams for old months 11 / 2000 and 1 / 2001 but global counterparty said this deal should have black marlin pipeline company inc . instead of black marlin pipeline company effective 3 / 99 . the black marlin pipeline company was for an internal record ( when it was an enron entity ) .Subject: bammel football stuff

- the commishSubject: please read - important information for participants in the enron
savings plan
due to current business circumstances , on november 28 , 2001 , enron ' s board of directors adopted an amendment to the enron corp . savings plan . the amendment includes the following changes , which became effective on november 29 :
? savings plan contributions that are deducted from your november 30 paycheck will be matched by enron in cash rather than enron stock . the cash match will be placed into the fidelity freedom 2000 fund , the default fund for the plan .
? after november 30 , enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions . as an exception , the company will continue the union matching contributions to the plan .
? the savings plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in enron stock or one or more alternative investment options . effective immediately , diversification within the plan will also be allowed , regardless of your age , from company contribution accounts . this removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account . these accounts include all prior company contributions , qnec , and company match accounts .
to move funds :
on the web , choose " savings plan - - restricted employer acct transfer / reallocation " from the drop down menu .
on voice response , choose " request for fund transfer / reallocation of your restricted employer accounts . "
this will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts : company matching , union matching , prior matching , and qnec .
to avoid phone delays , we recommend that you access your account through the web at http : / / resources . hewitt . com / enron or through benefits . enron . com .Subject: fw : centana storage

rita ,
it looks like we will be making our bammel true - up payment to aep in the next couple of days . included in the payment to aep is a deduction for the sale of the centana storage gas . we are selling them 1 , 236 , 286 mmbtu @ $ 2 . 375 for a total of $ 2 , 936 , 179 . 25 . the sale is for september , 2001 production . we will need a deal put in sitara for that sale along with the appropriate pathing from storage by logistics . however , there is only 1 , 195 , 754 mmbtu on report 006 in unify ( for contracts 96018371 , 96014189 , and 96019236 ) . how do we account for this volumetic difference ? connie will be truing up the gl to match the current unify volume . the gl was short approx . 18 , 000 mmbtu because a beginning balance was not booked .
this needs to happen before the upcoming close .
thanks for you help in this matter .

phil schnorbachSubject: enron files chapter 11 reorganization
to all employees :
this morning enron took a series of actions designed to stabilize our situation and preserve the value in our businesses :
- - we filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter 11 of the u . s . bankruptcy code . contrary to popular belief , this does not mean we are out of business . what it does mean is that we have entered into a court - supervised process by which we can continue to operate most of our businesses , reorganize our finances , and explore various strategic , operational and financial alternatives , including the sale of non - core assets , in an orderly manner .
- - in connection with our filing for chapter 11 reorganization , enron is in active discussions with leading financial institutions for debtor - in - possession ( dip ) financing and expects to complete these discussions shortly . upon the completion and court approval of these arrangements , the new funding will be available immediately on an interim basis to supplement enron ' s existing capital and help the company fulfill obligations associated with operating its business , including its employee payroll and payments to vendors for goods and services provided on or after today ' s filing .
- - we filed a lawsuit against dynegy , alleging breach of contract and other causes of action for dynegy ' s wrongful termination of our proposed merger . we are asking the court for damages of not less than $ 10 billion .
- - we also announced this morning that we are in active discussions with various leading financial institutions about providing financial support to recapitalize and revitalize the company ' s wholesale energy trading operations under a new ownership structure . as contemplated , this recapitalized entity will be staffed with people from enron ' s current wholesale energy trading team , and will conduct counterparty transactions through enrononline .
these are the first steps in a strategic restructuring process that will allow enron to meet its obligations to its creditors and preserve the value in our core wholesale energy trading business . from an operational standpoint , our energy businesses - including our pipelines , utilities and other energy assets - are conducting safe and normal operations around the world , and will continue to do so .
as you know , the second and unavoidable part of our restructuring is to improve our financial position by implementing a comprehensive cost - savings program . this will entail a significant reduction in our work force . this is painful for all of us and our goal is for as many of you as is possible to know where you stand by the end of the day tuesday , though in some cases notification will take longer .
for our friends and colleagues who will lose their jobs as part of this process , you will remain on the company payroll for now . in addition , we will submit a severance pay plan to the bankruptcy court for approval . this approval must be received before we can begin paying severance benefits . we will be providing more information about this plan as soon as the court has made its determination .
i know these actions raise new questions about our company ' s future and what this means for each of us . your business unit leader will be holding floor meetings on monday to discuss these events with you . in addition , you can access a copy of the press release on . we will also have a q & a and other materials for you on monday . while there is a great deal we simply don ' t know yet , we hope these materials will help answer at least some of your questions .
when decisions are made affecting our company , people , and operations , we will let you know as quickly as possible . there is still considerable value and opportunity in our business . the strategic restructuring process that we are beginning will allow us to preserve that value and those opportunities .
on behalf of the board and entire management team , we greatly appreciate your patience , your professionalism and whatever support you can offer each other as we navigate through these tough times to a better future .

the latest is that if they want to keep their phones , they need to fill out a contract changing the liability to them .
we will have some in our office tomorrow around 1 ( ran out today ) and they can also pick one up at a cingular store . just make sure that they mail them back to me .
my home address is : 4501 shetland houston 77027
as for the cancellation of the corporate phones , that is not scheduled to take place yet , and may not right away .
if they just want to do a rate plan change , then they can do it via email ( have them email me ) or they can indicate it on their contract that they fill out to change liability .
the main thing to do is to fill out the contract to change liability , which also obligates them for one year .
as for the balances accrued up to date , they are not responsible for those . enron is .
good luck to you . i hope you get my email and i hope i get to see you again .
and , yes , i will be getting all new accounts now !

hi ! any word yet about the cell phones ? i ' m getting nervous , as are a lot of others , i ' m sure . some people in my group are really wanting to keep their phones , and they are asking me questions that i don ' t know the answers to . . . like what kinds of rate changes there will be , as well as to what point will the liability be theirs , and how far back will they have to pay to get the invoices current , if enron has not done so already .
how are you affected by this ? will cingular find another business that you will work out of ? just curious .

ho ho ho , we ' re around to that most wonderful time of the year - - - neon leaders retreat time !
i know that this time of year is extremely hectic , and that it ' s tough to think about anything past the holidays , but life does go on past the week of december 25 through january 1 , and that ' s what i ' d like you to think about for a minute .
on the calender that i handed out at the beginning of the fall semester , the retreat was scheduled for the weekend of january 5 - 6 . but because of a youth ministers conference that brad and dustin are connected with that week , we ' re going to change the date to the following weekend , january 12 - 13 . now comes the part you need to think about .
i think we all agree that it ' s important for us to get together and have some time to recharge our batteries before we get to far into the spring semester , but it can be a lot of trouble and difficult for us to get away without kids , etc . so , brad came up with a potential alternative for how we can get together on that weekend , and then you can let me know which you prefer .
the first option would be to have a retreat similar to what we ' ve done the past several years . this year we could go to the heartland country inn ( www . . com ) outside of brenham . it ' s a nice place , where we ' d have a 13 - bedroom and a 5 - bedroom house side by side . it ' s in the country , real relaxing , but also close to brenham and only about one hour and 15 minutes from here . we can golf , shop in the antique and craft stores in brenham , eat dinner together at the ranch , and spend time with each other . we ' d meet on saturday , and then return on sunday morning , just like what we ' ve done in the past .
the second option would be to stay here in houston , have dinner together at a nice restaurant , and then have dessert and a time for visiting and recharging at one of our homes on that saturday evening . this might be easier , but the trade off would be that we wouldn ' t have as much time together . i ' ll let you decide .
email me back with what would be your preference , and of course if you ' re available on that weekend . the democratic process will prevail - - majority vote will rule ! let me hear from you as soon as possible , preferably by the end of the weekend . and if the vote doesn ' t go your way , no complaining allowed ( like i tend to do ! )
have a great weekend , great golf , great fishing , great shopping , or whatever makes you happy !

jay ,
let ' s not assume what impact this will have . even though it is better to zero out deals we ( vm ) wouldn ' t want to go in and zero out 2000 deals .
we do have a few questions .
i would like to discuss what minimal impact is ? how do you know what impact this will have ? is there a reason this will have little impact ? do all of these d 2 d deals have zero volume associated with them ?
who decided to do this ?
why are we doing this ?
what time span are we talking ( production months / year )
let ' s determine the impact if any ?
i would like to meet with you guys and get more detail on why we are doing this and determine the impact ?
thanks ,

if a deal is killed it poses a problem for us in unify if there are any paths associated with the deal ; therefore , we request the deals be zeroed out . call me if this is a problem . also , we would appreciate further details on why these deals are being killed .
in addition , i have copied rita and mark from volume management for their input .

subject : update on employee expense reimbursement
post - petition expenses
effective immediately , the processing of expense reimbursement for business expenses incurred by employees after enron corp . ' s chapter 11 filing ( after december 2 nd ) has returned to normal . expenses will be reimbursed promptly upon submission . employees should conduct business travel in the ordinary course of business as approved by direct supervisors . new travel and entertainment guidelines regarding business travel and other employee expenses will be forthcoming . in the meantime , please use discretion as you incur expenses . all expenditures should be made with consideration given to enron ' s current financial situation .
pre - petition expenses
we will immediately begin to reimburse pre - petition expenses for current and former employees ( incurred prior to the december 2 nd chapter 11 filing ) up to a maximum of $ 5 , 000 . we understand that a number of employees have pre - petition expenses in excess of $ 5 , 000 . however , under the first day orders of the bankruptcy court , there is a $ 15 , 000 allowance per employee for unpaid pre - petition compensation , benefits , and related employee expenses . this $ 15 , 000 cap was imposed without input from enron management and counsel . we have sought clarification from the bankruptcy court to assure that this $ 15 , 000 cap does not include the reimbursement of medical , dental , or vision related expenses .
we have commenced a manual review of every individual with pending pre - petition expenses in excess of $ 5 , 000 . even prior to clarification from the court regarding the medical / dental / vision expense issue , we will begin to reimburse pre - petition expenses in excess of $ 5 , 000 and up to $ 15 , 000 as soon as we can verify that the aggregate reimbursements to an individual employee have not exceeded the $ 15 , 000 cap . unfortunately , since this will be a manual process , it will take some time to work through . employees with pre - petition business expenses in excess of $ 5 , 000 can assist us with this manual review process by providing a brief email summary of their situation , including the total amount of pending pre - petition medical / dental / vision claims , to expensereport @ enron . com .

hi all -
attached above is the master list of contracts we ' ll need for day 1 of newco . as the footnotes indicate , we ' ll also need new business party id ' s / passwords , an ebb agreement for all pipes and a tpa for each edi pipe ( tammy & i will be working on tpa ' s and ebb ' s ) . the timing indicated assumes that we have a clear newco structure , that the newco credit status has been identified , and that a duns number has been established . the two week estimate is built on working through the pipelines ' credit process as an entirely new entity and on turning the contracts through legal on each end , so it may be shorter for some of the simpler agreements but in any event we should estimate at least 3 - 5 days even for pooling agreements . for the ldc ' s and intrastates , we ' ll need to specifically identify what each requires .
as we discussed , we need to call each pipeline and identify the following information :
pipeline contact name and number ( i know some of you sent me this b / f - - but pls make sure that it ' s the legal / regulatory contact , not your business counterpart )
credit requirements for a new entity with an " a " credit rating ( they may just refer you to the tariff , if so , pls . ask them for a specific site so we can do the research )
get a sense of the reaction of the pipe / ldc regarding credit for the new entity - - we can set up a discussion between our legal and theirs so we can resolve those issues and move forward to contracting .
in the event that any of them raise the issue of paying any of the old enron bills , just reiterate that we ' re setting up a completely new entity and give them bob ' s , mine , or jeff hodge ' s name to discuss the estate issues .
if there are different requirements for different service levels ( ie , pooling vs . it vs . ft ) , pls ask them to specify so that we can get the easier agreements in place first and get business started on the pipe .
we need to get a hard copy of the contract for each service level - - pls . ask the pipe / ldc to fax it over or give you a specific reference to their online tariff where we can find it . once we have those together , i ' ll run the traps with legal .
it would also be helpful if each desk identifies a first and second tier of priority pipes and agreement so that we can get you up and running for the first tier , then work on the second .
i will be out of the office thursday & friday , but please call me on my cell phone at 713 - 516 - 2574 with any questions .

( iv ) due diligence
we continue the process with two new companies this week ( wednesday and thursday ) . andy zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on wednesday , please help him with his requirements .Subject: northern natural gas
yesterday , enron settled a procedural dispute with dynegy over northern natural gas . our settlement allows dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline , dismisses their texas lawsuit and extends enron ' s right to repurchase until june 30 . we reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring enron out of bankruptcy . while we would like to keep northern natural , we still have some 9 , 000 miles of safe , profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses .
the settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $ 10 billion damage claim against dynegy . it also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts .
we want to see a positive future for the employees working with northern natural gas . below is a copy of a message from stan horton further explaining this decision to the employees of enron transportation services .
ken
dear ets colleague :
on thursday , enron entered into a settlement over dynegy ' s exercise of its option to acquire the northern natural gas pipeline . the settlement allows dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while enron pursues its damage claim against dynegy .
in this respect , enron corp . has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of northern natural gas . consequently , enron corp . has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of northern natural gas to dynegy , while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved .
the company has concluded that with this settlement , enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly , as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court . for the northern natural gas employees , i believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day - to - day satisfaction of running a valuable , successful business .
beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe , reliable and efficient operation of northern natural gas .
over many years we have run high quality , cost conscious and profitable businesses in ets . keep up the good work !

subject : customersSubject: cleburne issues
daren , with megan gone i just wanted to touch base with you on the status of the enron payments owed to the cleburne plant . the current issues are as follows :
november gas sales $ 600 , 377 . 50
october payment to ena for txu pipeline charges $ 108 , 405 . 00
cleburne receivable from enron $ 708 , 782 . 50
less : november gas agency fees ( $ 54 , 000 . 00 )
net cleburne receivable from enron $ 654 , 782 . 50
per my discussions with megan , she stated that about $ 500 k of the $ 600 k nov gas sales was intercompany ( desk to desk ) sales , with the remainder from txu . are we able to settle any intercompany deals now ? are we able to settle with txu ?
additionally , you ' ll see that i included the oct txu payment in the receivable owed to cleburne also . this is because i always pay megan based upon the pipeline estimates in michael ' s file , even though they are not finalized until the next month . therefore in my november payment to enron , i paid ena for october ' s estimate , of which megan would have paid the final bill on 12 / 26 / 01 when it was finalized . however , i had to pay the october bill directly last month , even though i had already sent the funds to ena in november . therefore , i essentially paid this bill twice ( once to ena in nov & once to txu in dec ) . i deducted the november agency fees from these receivable totals to show the net amount owed to cleburne .
please advise as to the status of these bills . you can reach me at 713 - 853 - 7280 . thanks .

dynegy not opposed to enron auction ; senate subcommittee to issue 51 subpoenas
nearly 20 of bankrupt enron corp . ' s creditors have apparently filed motions to delay the scheduled auction of the company ' s trading assets this week , but one - time merger partner and creditor dynegy corp . will not be one of them , a spokesman said wednesday . however , whether the auction proceeds as planned , enron is facing more obstacles on the legal front with 51 subpoenas requesting documents expected to be issued friday by the senate ' s permanent subcommittee on investigations .
the u . s . bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york has been asked by the creditors to delay approving any offer for enron ' s trading business , once the most profitable unit of the company . the motion to delay was requested to allow the creditors time to look at the assets up for sale . included in the auction are assets from its enrononline operation , which enron would like to use in a joint venture with a cash - rich company .
under enron ' s proposal , a 51 % joint venture partner would form a new company with enron to be called new energy trading co . , or netco . enron would contribute information technology and back office systems among other things , in exchange for a 49 % stake . as of late monday , ubs ag , citigroup inc . and bp had made bids for some of the assets .
among those opposing the auction , now set for thursday with a decision on the winning bids as early as friday , is the royal bank of scotland group plc , which said , " absent a disclosure of the intended uses for the proceeds of this sale , the creditors are unable to gauge that the benefits are adequate , appropriate and directed to the proper beneficiaries . " kansas city , mo - based aquila also is opposed to the auction because of concerns about how the proceeds would be used . aquila wants the auction ' s proceeds put in escrow until it is determined which units of enron receive the money .
however , dynegy does not plan to oppose the auction , said company spokesman steve stengel , who also expressed surprise that any company would want to delay it . " dynegy has not taken any action to delay the sale of enron ' s trading business , " he told ngi . stengel also confirmed that the scheduled sale of northern natural gas co . from enron to dynegy is still set to close by the end of january .
still to come is word on who and what documents are being subpoenaed by the senate ' s permanent subcommittee on investigations . the subpoenas will be served on enron , its accounting firm andersen and 49 individual officers , employees and members of the board of directors . the subcommittee is one of five congressional panels investigating the fallen giant along with the u . s . securities and exchange commission , the department of labor and the department of justice .
" the subcommittee is looking into the role of the officers and board members , the role of the auditors , and the role of special - purpose entities , " a subcommittee spokesman told reuters . these are some of the same types of things being investigated by the house of representatives financial services committee , the senate commerce committee and the house and senate energy committees . the spokesman said the subpoenas would allow enron and the others " several weeks " to respond .Subject: re : tenaska iv

we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

ok , since we don ' t appear to be able to hook up by phone . . .
with respect to ( 1 ) , if ena can ' t effectively manage the plant ' s positions , who can you recommend that could under the same terms ? as you recall , the equity owners do have a buyer interested in the asset , so the arrangement would probably be short - term at best .
i think the bank that has collateral rights to the asset will be concerned with the payable . with respect to ( 2 ) , did your discussions with legal lead to any conclusions with respect to compensating the project ? what is the amount of the claim the project has back to ena ? i agree that the project should make payments directly to the suppliers and lone star .
i ' m around , give me a call if you get a chance .
